## Requirements

## Reporting bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/JeanStiletto/AccessibleArena/issues

Include the following information:

- What you were doing when the bug occurred
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Your screen reader and version
- Attach the MelonLoader log file from your MTGA folder:
  - WotC: `C:\Program Files\Wizards of the Coast\MTGA\MelonLoader\Latest.log`
  - Steam: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MTGA\MelonLoader\Latest.log`

## Known issues

- Space key pass priority is not always reliable (the mod clicks the button directly as fallback)
- Deck builder deck list cards show only name and quantity, not full card details
- PlayBlade queue type selection (Ranked, Open Play, Brawl) may not always set the correct game mode

For the full list, see docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md.

## Troubleshooting

**No speech output after launching the game**
- Make sure your screen reader is running before launching MTG Arena
- Check that `Tolk.dll` and `nvdaControllerClient64.dll` are in the MTGA root folder (the installer places them automatically)
- Check the MelonLoader log in your MTGA folder (`MelonLoader\Latest.log`) for errors

**Game crashes on startup or mod not loading**
- Make sure MelonLoader is installed.
- If the game updated recently, MelonLoader or the mod may need to be reinstalled. Run the installer again.
- Check that `AccessibleArena.dll` is in the `Mods\` folder inside your MTGA installation

**Mod was working but stopped after a game update**
- MTG Arena updates can overwrite MelonLoader files. Run the installer again to reinstall both MelonLoader and the mod.
- If the game changed its internal structure significantly, the mod may need an update. Check for new releases on GitHub.

**Keyboard shortcuts not working**
- Make sure the game window is focused (click on it or Alt+Tab to it)
- Press F1 to check if the mod is active. If you hear the help menu, the mod is running.
- Some shortcuts only work in specific contexts (duel shortcuts only work during a duel)

**Wrong language**
- Press F2 to open the settings menu, then use Enter to cycle through languages

## Building from source

Requirements: .NET SDK (any version that supports targeting net472)

- ZFBrowser.dll

MelonLoader DLLs (`MelonLoader.dll`, `0Harmony.dll`) come from your MelonLoader installation.
