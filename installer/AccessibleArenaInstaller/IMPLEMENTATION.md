# Accessible Arena Installer - Implementation Documentation

## Overview

Single-file C# WinForms installer that:
- Uses standard Windows dialogs (screen reader accessible)
- Installs MelonLoader + mod + dependencies
- Supports updates and uninstallation
- Optional logging for troubleshooting

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** C# (.NET Framework 4.7.2)
- **UI Framework:** WinForms (native Windows dialogs - inherently accessible)
- **File Embedding:** Standard EmbeddedResource (for Tolk DLLs and locale files)
- **Localization:** InstallerLocale static class with embedded JSON resources, 12 languages
- **Admin rights:** Application manifest requesting `requireAdministrator`
- **HTTP client:** System.Net.Http for GitHub API calls
- **ZIP extraction:** System.IO.Compression for MelonLoader installation

## File Delivery Strategy

**Embedded in installer:**
- Tolk.dll (screen reader communication)
- nvdaControllerClient64.dll (NVDA controller)

**Downloaded at install time:**
- MelonLoader (ZIP from official GitHub releases - extracted manually)
- AccessibleArena.dll (from your GitHub releases)

**Rationale:** Tolk DLLs rarely change, MelonLoader updates frequently, mod updates with releases.

## Installation Flow

### Step 1: Pre-flight Checks (in Program.cs)
1. Check if running as admin (via manifest, should always be true)
2. Check if MTGA.exe is running → Block with message

### Step 2: Version Check
1. Fetch latest mod version from GitHub API (used for display and comparison)
2. Check if mod DLL exists in default MTGA location
3. If mod exists: Get installed version from **registry first** (stores GitHub tag from last install), falling back to DLL assembly version
4. Compare installed vs latest to determine update status

Three outcomes:
- **Update available:** Show Update Available Dialog (Update Mod / Full Install / Close)
- **Mod up to date:** Show "Mod Up to Date" dialog with version, offer Close or Full Reinstall
- **No mod installed:** Proceed directly to Welcome Wizard

### Step 3: Welcome Wizard (two pages)
**Page 1 - Welcome:**
- Mod description and version to be installed (e.g. "Version to install: v0.6")
- Language dropdown (auto-detected from OS, changes installer UI live)
- Next button

**Page 2 - MTGA Download:**
- Instructions to download MTGA if not yet installed
- **Direct Download** button - Downloads MTGAInstaller.exe
- **Download Page** button - Opens MTGA website
- **Back** button - Return to page 1
- **Install Mod** button - Proceeds to installation

### Step 4: Path Detection
- Check registry for previous install location
- Check default: `C:\Program Files\Wizards of the Coast\MTGA`
- Check x86 Program Files as fallback
- If not found: User selects via FolderBrowserDialog

### Step 5: Main Installation (MainForm.cs)
**Full Install Mode:**
1. **Copy Tolk DLLs** - Extract embedded resources to MTGA root
2. **MelonLoader Check/Install:**
   - If not installed: Ask user, then download ZIP and extract
   - If already installed: Ask if user wants to reinstall or keep existing
3. **Create Mods folder** if it doesn't exist
4. **Download Mod DLL** from GitHub releases (no redundant version check)
5. **Configure mod language** if selected
6. **Hide MelonLoader console** - sets `hide_console = true` in `UserData/Loader.cfg`
7. **Register in Add/Remove Programs** - stores GitHub release tag as version

**Update Only Mode:**
1. Skip Tolk DLLs and MelonLoader
2. **Fetch latest version** from GitHub (for registry)
3. **Download Mod DLL** from GitHub releases
4. **Update registry** with GitHub release tag

**Version registration:** The registry always stores the GitHub release tag (e.g. "0.6"), not the DLL assembly version. This prevents stale assembly versions from causing perpetual "update available" cycles.

### Step 6: Completion
- Show success message (with first-launch warning if MelonLoader was installed)
- Ask about log file only if there were errors/warnings
- Optionally launch MTGA

## MelonLoader Installation Details

**Important Discovery:** MelonLoader's official installer does NOT support silent/CLI installation. It only has GUI mode.

**Solution:** Manual ZIP extraction (same as their documented "manual install" method):
1. Download `MelonLoader.x64.zip` from GitHub releases
2. Extract to MTGA folder:
   - `version.dll` → MTGA root (proxy DLL that bootstraps MelonLoader)
   - `dobby.dll` → MTGA root (required for Il2Cpp games like MTGA)
   - `MelonLoader/` folder → MTGA root (runtime files)

**First Launch:** After MelonLoader installation, first game launch takes 1-2 minutes while MelonLoader generates managed assemblies from Il2Cpp. This is normal and only happens once.

## Uninstallation

**Trigger methods:**
- Windows Settings → Apps → Accessible Arena → Uninstall
- Control Panel → Programs and Features
- Command line: `AccessibleArenaInstaller.exe /uninstall`
- Silent: `AccessibleArenaInstaller.exe /uninstall /quiet`

**What gets removed:**
- AccessibleArena.dll from Mods folder
- Tolk.dll and nvdaControllerClient64.dll from MTGA root
- Backup files (.backup)
- Empty Mods folder (if no other mods)
- Registry uninstall entry

**Optional:** User can choose to also remove MelonLoader (checkbox in UninstallForm)

## Registry Entries

Location: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\AccessibleArena`

Values:
- DisplayName: "Accessible Arena"
- DisplayVersion: (mod version)
- Publisher: "Accessible Arena Project"
- InstallLocation: (MTGA path)
- InstallDate: (YYYYMMDD)
- UninstallString: (path to installer with /uninstall flag)
- NoModify: 1
- NoRepair: 1
- EstimatedSize: 5000 (KB)
- URLInfoAbout: (GitHub repo URL)
- HelpLink: (GitHub issues URL)

## Logging

**Behavior:**
- All operations are logged to memory buffer
- On successful install: Only asks to save log if there were warnings/errors
- On failure: Always asks if user wants to save log file
- Log saved to Desktop as `AccessibleArena_Install.log`

**Rationale:** Users doing clean installs don't need log files cluttering their Desktop.

## Configuration (Config.cs)

Update these values before building for release:
```csharp
ModRepositoryUrl = "https://github.com/JeanStiletto/AccessibleArena"
ModDllName = "AccessibleArena.dll"
Publisher = "Accessible Arena Project"
DisplayName = "Accessible Arena"
```

## Command Line Arguments

```
AccessibleArenaInstaller.exe                      # Normal install (shows welcome)
AccessibleArenaInstaller.exe /uninstall           # Uninstall with UI
AccessibleArenaInstaller.exe /uninstall /quiet    # Silent uninstall
AccessibleArenaInstaller.exe "C:\path\to\MTGA"    # Install to specific path
```

## Accessibility Considerations

- All dialogs use standard Windows controls (inherently screen reader accessible)
- Progress updates via Label controls (announced by screen readers)
- Error messages in standard MessageBox (screen reader announces)
- No custom controls that might break accessibility
- Keyboard navigation works by default in WinForms

## Build Instructions

**Debug build (for testing):**
```powershell
cd installer\AccessibleArenaInstaller
dotnet build
```
Output: `bin\Debug\net472\AccessibleArenaInstaller.exe`

**Release build (for distribution):**
```powershell
dotnet build -c Release
```
Output: `bin\Release\net472\AccessibleArenaInstaller.exe`

## Testing Checklist

After installation, verify:
```powershell
# Check Tolk DLLs exist
Test-Path "C:\Program Files\Wizards of the Coast\MTGA\Tolk.dll"
Test-Path "C:\Program Files\Wizards of the Coast\MTGA\nvdaControllerClient64.dll"

# Check Mods folder exists
Test-Path "C:\Program Files\Wizards of the Coast\MTGA\Mods"

# Check registry entry
Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\AccessibleArena"
```

## Error Handling

All errors:
1. Logged to buffer with stack trace
2. Shown to user via MessageBox
3. User offered option to save log file

Common errors handled:
- MTGA not found (user selects folder manually)
- MTGA running (blocked with message)
- Network error downloading (continues without mod, shows manual download link)
- GitHub rate limit / repo not found (warns user, continues)
- Permission denied (shouldn't happen with admin manifest)

## Known Issues

### MelonLoader doesn't load when using "Launch MTGA after installation"

**Symptom:** User has MelonLoader already installed, skips the reinstall prompt, checks "Launch MTGA after installation", but when the game starts MelonLoader doesn't load. However, launching MTGA manually afterwards works fine.

**Cause:** The installer runs with administrator privileges (required for writing to Program Files). When `Process.Start()` launches MTGA.exe from the installer, the game inherits the elevated admin context. MelonLoader or the game may behave differently when running with unexpected admin privileges.

**Workarounds:**
1. Don't use "Launch MTGA after installation" - launch the game manually instead
2. Launch MTGA from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut after installation completes

**Possible fixes (not yet implemented):**
- Launch via Explorer: `Process.Start("explorer.exe", exePath)` - this runs the game in normal user context
- Use `CreateProcessAsUser` API to launch as the normal user
- Show a warning when the checkbox is checked explaining this limitation

**Status:** Partially mitigated by launching via MTGALauncher instead of MTGA.exe directly (see Version 1.7 changelog). The admin context issue may still apply but is less impactful since the launcher handles game updates before starting.

## Future Enhancements

Not yet implemented:
- In-mod update checker (notify user on game launch if update available)
- Code signing (reduces Windows SmartScreen warnings)
- Checksum verification of downloads
- Fix for "Launch MTGA" admin context issue (see Known Issues)

## Implementation History

**Phase 1: Core Installer**
- Project setup with .NET Framework 4.7.2 WinForms
- Admin manifest for UAC elevation
- Tolk DLLs as embedded resources
- Basic file extraction and path detection

**Phase 2: MelonLoader Integration**
- Discovered MelonLoader installer has no CLI mode
- Implemented manual ZIP download and extraction
- Added progress reporting during download

**Phase 3: Mod Download**
- GitHub API integration for release checking
- Version comparison logic
- Download with progress reporting
- Update detection (installed vs latest)

**Phase 4: Polish**
- Add/Remove Programs registry integration
- Uninstaller with UI and quiet mode
- Command line argument parsing
- Improved error handling

**Post-Phase Improvements:**
- Welcome dialog with MTGA download option
- MelonLoader "already installed" dialog with reinstall option
- Optional logging (only saves on errors or user request)

## Version Matching (Important)

There are **three** version numbers that must stay in sync for releases:

- **GitHub tag** — the tag name from the latest release (e.g., `v0.6.9`). Fetched via GitHub API, `v` prefix stripped. This is the **source of truth** for releases.
- **Assembly version** — the version baked into the compiled DLL. Read from the installed file via `AssemblyName.GetAssemblyName()`. Used by the installer for update detection.
- **MelonInfo version** — the version string in the `[assembly: MelonInfo(...)]` attribute. Displayed to users at mod launch (e.g., "Accessible Arena v0.6.9 launched"). Accessed at runtime via `Info.Version`.

### Single Source of Truth: `Directory.Build.props`

All three are derived from a single place. `src/Directory.Build.props` defines `<ModVersion>`:

```xml
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <ModVersion>0.6.9</ModVersion>
    <Version>$(ModVersion)</Version>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

This feeds both version numbers automatically:
- **Assembly version** — `<Version>` inherits from `<ModVersion>`, so the compiled DLL gets the right version.
- **MelonInfo version** — A build target in the csproj generates `VersionInfo.g.cs` (into `obj/`) containing `internal const string Value = "0.6.9"`. The `[assembly: MelonInfo(...)]` attribute references `VersionInfo.Value` instead of a hardcoded string.

For **CI release builds**, the GitHub Actions workflow passes `-p:ModVersion=` from the git tag, overriding the value in `Directory.Build.props`. This flows to both the assembly version and the generated MelonInfo constant automatically — no `sed` patching needed.

For **local dev builds**, just edit the one line in `Directory.Build.props`. After a release, bump it to the next version with a `-dev` suffix (e.g., `0.7.0-dev`).

### Pitfalls We Hit (Don't Repeat These)

**Pitfall 1: Missing `<Version>` in csproj**
If you don't set `<Version>`, .NET defaults the assembly version to `1.0.0.0`. If your GitHub tags are `v0.x`, the installer sees the installed DLL as version `1.0.0.0` which is numerically *higher* than any `0.x` release. Result: updates are never detected, even though the installed DLL is ancient.

The installer now treats `1.0.0.0` as `0.0.0.0` as a safety net (see `NormalizeVersion`), but don't rely on this. `Directory.Build.props` ensures a real version is always set.

**Pitfall 2: Version sources out of sync**
Before `Directory.Build.props`, the csproj `<Version>` and MelonInfo string were independent and frequently drifted apart (e.g., csproj at 0.6.7, MelonInfo at 0.6.6, changelog at 0.6.9). CI masked this for releases but local builds showed wrong versions. Now both derive from `<ModVersion>` so they can't drift.

**Pitfall 3: Redundant version checks after user confirmation**
If your installer shows an "Update Available" dialog and the user clicks "Update", don't re-check versions before downloading. A second version check can reach a different conclusion (network error, race condition, version format edge case) and silently skip the download the user just asked for. Once the user confirms, download unconditionally.

### Version Normalization

The installer normalizes versions to 4 components before comparing:
- `v0.5` becomes `0.5.0.0`
- `0.5.0.0` stays `0.5.0.0`
- `1.0.0.0` (the .NET default) is treated as `0.0.0.0`
- Pre-release suffixes stripped: `0.5.0-beta` becomes `0.5.0.0`

This means `v0.5` and `0.5.0.0` compare as equal, which is the desired behavior.

## Automated Releases with GitHub Actions (deprecated)

> **Note:** The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) no longer works because the game DLLs (`Core.dll`, `Assembly-CSharp.dll`, etc.) are not in the repository. The mod must be built locally against the game DLLs installed on your machine. Use the local release script described below instead.

The workflow extracted the version from the git tag and passed it to `dotnet build` via `-p:ModVersion=...`. See `.github/workflows/release.yml` for reference — it remains in the repo but will fail if triggered.

## Local Release Script

Since the mod must be built against game DLLs that cannot be uploaded to GitHub, releases are created locally using `tools/release.ps1`.

**Usage:**
```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File installer/release.ps1
```

No arguments needed. The script reads the version from `src/Directory.Build.props` and performs the full release automatically:

1. Reads `<ModVersion>` from `src/Directory.Build.props`
2. Pre-flight checks (clean working tree, tag doesn't exist, changelog section exists, tools available)
3. Builds mod in Release mode with correct version (`dotnet build -c Release -p:ModVersion=...`)
4. Builds installer in Release mode
5. Verifies both artifacts exist (`AccessibleArena.dll` + `AccessibleArenaInstaller.exe`)
6. Extracts release notes from `docs/CHANGELOG.md` for the matching version section
7. Creates an annotated git tag
8. Pushes the tag to remote
9. Creates the GitHub release via `gh` CLI with release notes and both artifacts

**Before running the script:**
1. Update `<ModVersion>` in `src/Directory.Build.props` to the new version
2. Add a `## vX.Y` section to `docs/CHANGELOG.md` with release notes
3. Commit both changes
4. Run the script

**Requirements:**
- `dotnet`, `git`, and `gh` CLIs must be installed and on PATH
- `gh` must be authenticated (`gh auth login`)
- Game must be installed (DLLs referenced during build)

Keep `Directory.Build.props` reasonably current for local dev builds (e.g., bump to `0.8.1-dev` after releasing `0.8`).

## Localization

### Architecture
- **InstallerLocale** static class loads flat JSON files embedded as assembly resources
- JSON parser copied from mod's `LocaleManager` (no external dependencies)
- Fallback chain: active language → English → key name
- `OnLanguageChanged` event allows live UI updates when language is switched

### API
- `InstallerLocale.Initialize(code)` - Load locale files, set initial language
- `InstallerLocale.SetLanguage(code)` - Switch language (fires OnLanguageChanged)
- `InstallerLocale.Get(key)` - Get localized string
- `InstallerLocale.Format(key, args)` - Get localized string with format parameters

### Supported Languages (12)
en, de, fr, es, it, pt-BR, ru, pl, ja, ko, zh-CN, zh-TW

### Adding a New Language
1. Copy `Locales/en.json` to `Locales/{code}.json`
2. Translate all values (keep keys, `{0}` placeholders, and technical terms unchanged)
3. Add the language code to `LanguageDetector.SupportedLanguages` and `DisplayNames`
4. Rebuild - the wildcard `<EmbeddedResource Include="Locales\*.json" />` picks it up automatically

## Changelog
