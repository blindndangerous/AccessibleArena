# Changelog

All notable changes to Accessible Arena.

## v0.8.5

### Improved: Battlefield card selection in multi-select situations
- Enter now toggles selection on battlefield cards navigated via Tab (e.g. untap lands from Frantic Search)
- Selection count announcement distinguishes multi-select from single-target: multi-select shows "1 of 3 selected", single-target just says "selected"
- Fixed wrong "0 of 1 selected" announcement for single-target abilities like Eluge's flood counter

### Improved: Color Challenge labels show match type breakdown
- Color button labels now include AI/PvP match counts (e.g. "White, 0 of 5 nodes unlocked, 3 AI, 2 PvP")

### Fix: Hopefully fixed auto-advancing dropdowns in registration
- Extended post-dropdown Submit block from 3 frames (~50ms) to 500ms to cover the game's delayed form-advance

### Fix: Deck selection in challenge friend screen
- Pressing Enter on the deck name now correctly opens the deck selector instead of announcing "Deck Selected"
- Entering folders in the deck selector works reliably (no longer snaps back to the folder list)
- Simplified internal auto-entry logic: a single flag now prevents position restore from overriding any pending navigation

### New: Accessible achievements screen (thanks to blindndangerous)
- Achievements now use multi-level drill-down navigation: set tabs, achievement groups, individual achievements
- Group descriptions and completion status are read aloud
- Track, untrack, and claim achievements with Enter/Space sub-actions
- All achievement strings translated in all supported languages
- Note: any bugs are mine (frostbane) — I adapted the original design to match the mod's navigation patterns

### Fix: Play blade navigation when opened from a home screen objective
- When pressing Enter on a tracked Sparked-Rank achievement (Progress > Objectives), the Play blade now navigates correctly, matching the behavior of Play > Play
- Backspace now correctly closes the blade and returns to the objectives screen

### New: Spell cancel detection and cast type prefixes
- Cancelling a spell (e.g. during mana payment) now announces "Spell cancelled" instead of false "Spell resolved"
- Cast announcements now include type prefixes (Adventure, MDFC, Split, Disturb, Prototype, Room, Omen, Land)
- Backspace now clicks Undo/Cancel buttons during mana payment
- Mana sprite tags in prompts and buttons are parsed into readable names

### Fix: Backspace undo during mana payment
- Backspace now properly undoes mana tapping and cancels when you try to cast a spell without enough mana

### Improved: Backspace as universal cancel in duels
- Backspace now cancels more situations and acts as a safe cancel button
- Only moments where you can truly act require skip confirmation with Space
- Behavior may be adjusted depending on user feedback

### New: Skip turn shortcuts (Shift+Backspace / Ctrl+Backspace)
- Shift+Backspace: Pass until next opponent action you can react to (soft skip)
- Ctrl+Backspace: Skip the entire turn regardless of what the opponent does (force skip)
- Both are toggles — press again to cancel and regain priority
- Escalating Backspace behavior: Backspace (cancel) → Shift+Backspace (pass) → Ctrl+Backspace (skip turn)

### Fix: Focus guard for Steam overlay
- Mod input processing is now paused when the game loses focus (Steam overlay, Alt+Tab, etc.) to prevent state corruption

### Fix: German locale wildcards translation
- "Joker" corrected to "Wildcards" in German locale

## v0.8.4

### New: Letter navigation in menus
- Press A-Z to jump to the first menu item starting with that letter
- Repeat the same letter to cycle through matches (e.g., S, S to go from "Store" to "Settings")
- Type multiple letters quickly to build a prefix (e.g., "ST" finds "Store")
- Works in grouped navigation (searches group names or items within group) and Advanced Filters (searches within current row)
- Disabled in duels where letters are zone shortcuts
- WASD keys no longer act as arrow-key alternatives in menus (freed up for letter navigation)

### Improved: Duel performance
- Various performance improvements for battlefield navigation, combat scanning, and card state lookups during duels

### Fix: Card info navigation at zone boundaries
- Arrow Down now correctly reads card detail blocks after hitting end or beginning of a row, instead of re-reading the card name

### Improved: Advanced Filters set selection
- Advanced Filters now has a separate Sets row for navigating and toggling individual set filters
- Changing the format dropdown (e.g. Standard to Historic) automatically rescans the set list

### Fix: Play Blade backspace navigation
- Leaving a deck folder with Backspace no longer re-announces the entire screen and jumps to the first element
- Position is now correctly restored to the folder you exited from

## v0.8.3

### Fix: Friends panel and invite popup closing
- F4 now correctly closes the friends panel (was silently failing due to wrong method name)
- Backspace now closes the friends panel via SocialUI.Minimize()
- F4 works during popups (e.g., can close friends panel while invite popup is open)
- InviteFriendPopup now closes on Backspace via FriendInvitePanel.Close()
- Removed non-functional send button from invite popup; press Enter in the input field to send requests

### Improved: Challenging friends now fully functional
- Diverse issues fixed and challenge screen cleaned up
- Backspace now reliably closes the invite popup via dismiss overlay detection (game's own close mechanism)
- Cancelling the "leave challenge?" confirmation no longer breaks challenge navigation state
- After cancelling leave, user is automatically re-entered into the challenge group
- Dismiss overlay detection now finds CustomButton-based overlays (not just standard Unity Buttons)

### Experimental: Chat support
- Allows sending chat messages to friends
- Tab to switch between conversations
- This is an early implementation and will need improvements — may break in some situations

### Fix: Spell cast and resolved announcements now in correct order
- Previously, "Spell resolved" could be announced before "Cast [card name]" when the opponent auto-passes
- Both announcements now use the same frame delay, ensuring cast is always announced first

### Fix: Vehicles now show power and toughness
- Vehicle cards (e.g., Gleiter der Reisenden, Ortungsrad-Kundschafter) now display power/toughness in card info blocks
- Previously, P/T extraction was limited to creatures only — vehicles were skipped even though they have P/T on the card model

### Fix: Decorative 3D reward popups no longer lock mod
- 3D reward animations (spinning coin/XP previews) on objective screens were being tracked as real popups, blocking popup detection and causing navigation lockout
- Decorative panels are now excluded at every level: panel tracking, popup mode, and overlay filtering

### New: Challenge Tiles in Friends Panel
- Incoming challenge requests now appear in a "Challenges" group when browsing the friends panel
- Active challenges (ones you created) also appear in the same group
- Navigate challenge entries with Up/Down, cycle actions with Left/Right
- Incoming challenge actions: Accept, Decline, Block, Add Friend
- Active challenge action: Open (reopens the challenge screen)
- Challenge section force-opens and tiles are created via UpdateChallengeList on panel scan
- Localized group name and action labels for all 12 languages

## v0.8.2

### New: Brawl Commander Deck Building
- Commander empty slot button now activates correctly — filters collection to show only valid commanders
- Select a legendary creature or planeswalker from the filtered collection to set it as commander

### New: Color Challenge node info blocks
- When on the Color Challenge screen, challenge node info is now accessible via Up/Down navigation
- Each objective node (I through V) shows its status (Completed, Current, Available, Locked)
- Shows match type for each node (PvP Match or AI Match)
- Shows reward text from the game's data model when available (e.g., gold, wildcards, card styles)
- Indicates when a node includes a deck upgrade (new cards added)
- Reward popup text (title and description) is included when the bubble popup is visible
- Falls back to track-level summary (e.g., "3 of 5 nodes unlocked") when node display is not active
- Info blocks refresh automatically when switching between colors
- Filters out developer placeholder text in reward descriptions
- Reads directly from the game's CampaignGraphTrackModule, objective bubbles, and strategy node data

### New: Extended Tutorial Tips in Help Menu
- Added "Tips for new users" category to F1 Help Menu with 7 entries
- Covers Space/Backspace usage, combat blocking workflow, extended card info (I key), mana color picker, command zone shortcuts, full control and phase stops
- Added to all 12 locale files

### New: Fact or Fiction (Split/SelectGroup) Browser
- Added accessible browser for Fact or Fiction and similar card divider effects
- Zone-based navigation with card ownership tracking

### New: Home Screen NavToken and Objective Labels
- NavToken elements (Jump In/Draft tokens) now read token count and description
- Achievement objectives read name and progress (e.g. "Achievement: A Party of None, 0/1")
- Timer objectives read as "Bonus Timer" instead of raw element name
- Unknown objective types fall back to scanning all text children

### New: Color Challenge Button Labels
- Color buttons now show track progress on their labels

### Fixed: Auto-Craft on Deck List
- Fixed auto-craft triggering incorrectly on deck list card activation with Craft filter enabled

### Fixed: Help Menu F4 Friends Panel
- F4 now shows Friends panel, command zone moved to zones section

### Fixed: Color Challenge Backspace Navigation
- Backspace now re-expands the color list when a color is selected (blade collapsed)
- Backspace from the color list (blade expanded) still navigates Home
- Previously Backspace always went Home regardless of blade state

### Fixed: Jump In Packet Order
- Packet tiles in Jump In now navigate in consistent top-to-bottom, left-to-right grid order
- Root cause: child elements inside each packet tile had offset positions causing chaotic sort
- Fix: sort uses the parent `JumpStartPacket` tile's position instead of the child element's position

### Fixed: New Deck Button Always Visible
- Removed automatic folder collapsing on Backspace exit — deck folders now stay open
- New Deck button is no longer hidden when the "My Decks" folder was collapsed

### Fixed: Input Field Behavior in Web Browser
- Tab between text fields now auto-enters edit mode, matching standard form navigation
- Backspace in a text field no longer exits the browser

### Fixed: Dismiss Button and Redundant Announcements
- Hidden Dismiss button from navigation, suppressed redundant announcements

### Fixed: Multi-Zone Browser Confirm
- SelectCardsMultiZone browser now recognizes SingleButton for confirm action

### Fixed: Pack Openings
- Fixed card names, navigation order, and card details during booster pack opening

### Translations: Added Missing Translations
- Translated all remaining English fallback keys across all 11 languages (349 translations)
- Covers help tips, Color Challenge strings, SelectGroup (Fact or Fiction pile choice) strings, screen names, and UI labels

## v0.8.1

### New: Local Release Script
- Added `installer/release.ps1` for one-command releases (builds, tags, publishes to GitHub)
- GitHub Actions workflow no longer works since game DLLs are not in the repository
- Release script reads version from `Directory.Build.props`, extracts changelog notes, and creates GitHub release via `gh` CLI

### Improved: Full Localization Sync
- All 11 non-English locale files synced with English (missing keys added, untranslated strings translated)
- Fixed encoding corruption in zh-CN, ja, ko locale files
- Localized hardcoded deck status strings (missing cards, invalid deck, unavailable, etc.)
- Updated DuelKeybindingsHint across all languages to match current keybindings

## v0.8

### Massive Internal Refactoring
- Major codebase cleanup and restructuring for long-term maintainability

### New: Store Pack Selection by Set
- Navigate between sets in the Store Packs tab with arrow keys (48 sets)
- Set name announced on selection change with item count

### New: Localized Set Names
- Set names in store pack selection now use the game's localization system instead of 3-letter codes
- Dynamically resolves via `Languages.ActiveLocProvider.GetLocalizedText("General/Sets/" + setCode)`
- Works in all languages the game supports, automatically covers new sets

### New: Localized Pack Names in Reward Popups
- Reward popups now announce pack set names (e.g., "Lorwyns Finsternis Pack") instead of generic "Booster Pack"
- Reads pack data from ContentControllerRewards before the game consumes it
- Converts CollationId to set code via CollationMapping enum, then resolves localized name

### Improved: Pack Opening Experience
- Pack openings now closely match the sighted experience of revealing cards one by one
- Animation auto-skipped for accessibility, all cards spawn face-down for manual reveal
- Cards ordered commons-first, rare/mythic last for natural dramaturgy
- I key works during pack openings for extended card info

### New: X-Spell Support (ChooseXNavigator)
- X-cost spells, "choose any amount", and die roll prompts are now fully accessible
- Detects the `View_ChooseXInterface` popup automatically during gameplay
- Up/Down adjusts value by 1, PageUp/PageDown by 5, Enter/Space confirms, Backspace cancels
- Announces current value, min/max limits, and confirmation

### New: Creature Type Selection Browser
- KeywordSelection browser (creature type picker) is now navigable
- Reads all available keywords from the game's data layer, bypassing InfiniteScroll virtualization
- Tab/Left/Right navigate keywords, Enter toggles selection, Space confirms
- Home/End jump to first/last keyword
- Show All button expands to full creature type list

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed pack openings showing 0 cards after detection rewrite
- Fixed reward popups not closing
- Fixed card count not announced when adding or removing cards in deck builder
- Fixed various dropdown navigation issues

## v0.7.4-dev

### Fix: Wrong Card Played After Tab Then Arrow Navigation
- Pressing Enter after Tab → Left/Right played the card from the Tab highlight, not the one the user arrow-navigated to
- Root cause: Arrow navigation in ZoneNavigator didn't reclaim zone ownership from HotHighlightNavigator, so Enter activated its stale index
- Fix: ZoneNavigator reclaims ownership on Left/Right/Home/End, letting it handle Enter with the correct card
- Files: ZoneNavigator.cs

### Fix: Friend Select Dropdown in Invite Opponent Popup
- Friend-picker dropdown in the invite opponent popup now works correctly
- Was misidentified because it is a sibling of the input field (not a child) with `value=-1` and empty caption
- `GetDropdownDisplayValue` fallback reads `options[0].text` when caption is empty and value is -1
- Single-item dropdown (one friend online) handles arrow keys gracefully: consumed and re-announced instead of going silent
- Focus re-set on dropdown before Enter selection to ensure correct click target
- Files: BaseNavigator.cs, DropdownStateManager.cs

### Fix: Deck Count Not Announced on No-Op Card Activation
- Pressing Enter on an unowned collection card in deck builder no longer announces "60/60 Karten" when nothing changed
- Root cause: `_announceDeckCountOnRescan` flag always triggered card count announcement after rescan, even when the count didn't change
- Fix: Capture card count text before rescan, compare after, only announce if it actually changed
- Files: GeneralMenuNavigator.cs

### Fix: Craft Popup Owned Count
- Craft popup now shows the correct owned count instead of always showing 4
- Root cause: Owned count was derived from the number of `_CraftPips` GameObjects (always 4 slots), not the actual ownership
- Fix: Read `_collectedQuantity` field from `CardViewerController` via reflection, which holds the real value from `Inv.Cards`
- Files: BaseNavigator.cs

### Refactor: Collection Card Activation Simplified
- Collection card activation now simulates a left click instead of calling `OpenCardViewer` directly via reflection
- Left click lets the game handle the action naturally: add to deck if owned, open craft popup if unowned/in crafting mode
- `InputManager.BlockNextEnterKeyUp` still prevents the Enter KeyUp from triggering auto-craft via `PopupManager.HandleKeyUp` → `OnEnter()` → `OnCraftClicked()`
- Removed `CraftConfirmationPopup.cs` — native game crafting with stepper support replaces custom popup
- Files: UIActivator.cs, InputManager.cs, KeyboardManagerPatch.cs

### Fix: Advanced Filters Navigator Stability
- Fixed OK button closing the entire deck builder instead of just the filters popup
- Root cause: UIActivator had blanket special handling for any button named "MainButton", which also matched the filters popup's OK button, triggering `WrapperDeckBuilder.OnDeckbuilderDoneButtonClicked()`
- Fix: UIActivator now skips the deck builder MainButton shortcut when the button is inside a popup (`IsInsidePopup` check)
- Fixed false activation on deck builder scene load — the popup GameObject is briefly `activeInHierarchy` during initialization
- Replaced expensive `FindObjectsOfType<Transform>` per-frame scan with `PanelStateManager.IsPanelActive()` check via AlphaDetector (event-driven, no false positives)
- Files: AdvancedFiltersNavigator.cs, UIActivator.cs

### Refactor: PopupHandler Unified into BaseNavigator
- Popup handling is now built into `BaseNavigator` — the separate `PopupHandler` class has been removed
- All navigators inherit popup support automatically; just call `EnablePopupDetection()` in `OnActivated()`
- Overridable hooks: `OnPopupDetected()`, `OnPopupClosed()`, `IsPopupExcluded()` for custom behavior
- Popup mode saves/restores navigator elements and index, creates dedicated InputFieldEditHelper and DropdownEditHelper instances for popup content
- On popup close, restored element labels are refreshed to pick up changes made while popup was open
- Navigators simplified: SettingsMenuNavigator, DraftNavigator, MasteryNavigator, StoreNavigator, GeneralMenuNavigator all reduced by removing per-navigator popup boilerplate
- Files: BaseNavigator.cs (popup mode region added), PopupHandler.cs (deleted), GeneralMenuNavigator.cs, SettingsMenuNavigator.cs, MasteryNavigator.cs, StoreNavigator.cs, DraftNavigator.cs

### Fix: Craft Popup Rework
- Replaced custom `CraftConfirmationPopup` with native game `CardViewerPopup` — craft pips replaced with single owned count + stepper for craft quantity
- Cancel button found via reflection (`_cancelButton` on `CardViewerController`) for reliable popup dismissal
- Files: BaseNavigator.cs, GeneralMenuNavigator.cs

### Fix: Popup Mode Stability (Multiple Fixes)
- Fixed popup close detection: exit popup mode on any non-popup panel change, not just when panel becomes null
- Fixed GeneralMenuNavigator popup mode not restoring correctly after navigator reactivation
- Fixed stale labels in grouped navigator after popup close: labels now refresh from live UI text
- Fixed Enter key blocked on popup buttons when previous element was a toggle (toggle submit blocking cleared on popup entry)
- Files: BaseNavigator.cs, GeneralMenuNavigator.cs, GroupedNavigator.cs

### Fix: Planeswalker Ability Text in Activation Browser
- Activating a planeswalker opens a SelectCards browser with one card per ability — all three now show their specific ability text instead of just the card name
- Root cause: ability CDCs use the ability ID as their GrpId with empty AbilityIds/Abilities arrays
- Fix: parent card context is cached during normal ability extraction and used to look up ability text via the provider
- Also filters garbage provider responses (`#NoTranslationNeeded`, `Ability #NNNNN`)
- Files: CardModelProvider.cs

### Fix: Loyalty Counter Duplication on Battlefield
- Planeswalkers on the battlefield no longer announce loyalty twice in the P/T info block
- Root cause: explicit Loyalty property AND Instance.Counters[Loyalty] both added to the block
- Fix: skip Loyalty counter type in the Counters loop (explicit property handles it)
- Files: CardModelProvider.cs

### Fix: False Ability Text on Stack Cards
- Vanilla creatures (and other cards without abilities) on the stack no longer show spurious ability IDs in their rules block
- Root cause: ability CDC fallback was too broad, firing for any card with empty AbilityIds
- Fix: fallback now only triggers when the parent ability cache confirms the GrpId is a known ability ID
- Files: CardModelProvider.cs

### New: Deck Type/Subtype Details in Deck Info
- Cards row in deck info now includes type/subtype breakdown: creature subtypes, other type distribution, and land subtypes
- Example: "Creatures: 16, 3 Dinosaur, 5 Goblin 27%. Others: 4 Sorcery, 8 Instant 25%. Lands: 25, 12 Mountain"
- Uses game's DeckTypesDetails widget via reflection (SetDeck, ItemParent, DeckDetailsLineItem)
- Populates types lazily, skips re-population if ItemParent already has children (avoids Unity deferred Destroy duplication)
- Files: DeckInfoProvider.cs

### Fix: Popup Text Filtering for Deck Details
- DeckTypesDetails, DeckColorsDetails, and CosmeticSelectorController raw text filtered from DeckDetailsPopup
- Uses `CollectWidgetContentTransforms()` to find widget content Transforms and `IsChildOfAny()` with `Transform.IsChildOf()` — necessary because DeckTypesDetails items live under a separate ItemParent, not under the widget's own GameObject
- Text blocks matching button labels (e.g., "Avatare") deduplicated via `DeduplicateTextBlocksAgainstButtons()`
- Files: BaseNavigator.cs

### Fix: Popup Cancel Button False Positive
- Cancel button pattern matching now uses word-boundary `ContainsWord()` instead of `Contains()` — prevents "no" matching inside "butto-no-utline"
- Added "back" to cancel patterns so "BackButton" is correctly found
- Files: BaseNavigator.cs

### Fix: Dropdown Value Persistence in Popups
- Dropdown value changes in DeckDetailsPopup (and similar destroyed/recreated UI) now persist across close/reopen
- Root cause: `onValueChanged` was suppressed during selection and value was set with `SetValueWithoutNotify`, so the game's data model was never updated
- Fix: `OnDropdownItemSelected(value)` stores pending value; `OnDropdownClosed()` restores `onValueChanged` then fires it via `FireOnValueChanged()` to notify the game
- Cancel (Escape/Backspace) restores without firing — no spurious changes
- Files: DropdownStateManager.cs, BaseNavigator.cs

### Changed: Proprietary DLLs Removed from Repository
- Game DLLs removed from git tracking (libs/ folder)
- Project references updated to use game install path via MtgaPath/MtgaManagedPath/MelonLoaderPath properties
- Files: .gitignore, AccessibleArena.csproj

### Improved: Prompt Button Announcements & Counter Cleanup
- Meaningful prompt button choices (e.g., "Automatisch bezahlen", sacrifice/pay-life prompts) are now automatically announced when they appear, so you know a custom action is available
- Combat prompt buttons (attack/block) are suppressed via a short phase-change cooldown to avoid redundant announcements
- +1/+1 counters no longer announced in P/T block (already reflected in power/toughness values); all counters still available via K key
- Files: HotHighlightNavigator.cs, DuelNavigator.cs, DuelAnnouncer.cs, CardModelProvider.cs

### New: Planeswalker Loyalty & Counter Accessibility
- Planeswalker abilities now prefixed with loyalty cost in rules text (e.g., "+2: Search your library...", "-3: Koth deals...")
- Power/Toughness info block expanded: planeswalkers show "Loyalty 4", creatures with counters show "2/3, 3 +1/+1"
- New K hotkey announces all counters on currently focused card (works from any zone/navigator)
- Counter type names formatted: P1P1→"+1/+1", M1M1→"-1/-1", others use enum name
- Files: CardModelProvider.cs, DuelNavigator.cs, InputManager.cs, HelpNavigator.cs, Strings.cs, en.json, de.json

### New: Set Information in Card Details
- Card info now shows expansion set name in the last info block (e.g., "Foundations, Artist: John Avon")
- Reads ExpansionCode property from card model, maps to friendly name via existing set code table
- Artist block renamed to "Set and Artist" to reflect combined content
- Files: CardModelProvider.cs, CardDetector.cs, Strings.cs, en.json, de.json

### Fix: SelectNCounters Color Selection Browser
- Lands with "choose a color" ETB triggers (e.g. Thriving Heath / Gedeihende Heide) use a `SelectColorWorkflow` that reuses the `BrowserScaffold_SelectNCounters` scaffold with a scrollable list of color options
- Previously blocked all input because the scaffold had no cards and the color text options were not discovered
- Extended `DiscoverLargeScrollListChoices` to also run for `SelectNCounters` browsers when no cards are found, discovering clickable color options (e.g. "Blau", "Schwarz", "Rot", "Grün")
- Added post-confirm browser re-entry: when the same scaffold is reused for a new interaction (counter placement -> color selection), the browser now forces a full re-discovery instead of staying in stale state
- Also detects scaffold instance changes (different GameObject, same type) for re-entry
- Files: `BrowserNavigator.cs`

### New: Codex of the Multiverse Accessibility
- Full keyboard navigation for the Codex of the Multiverse (Learn to Play) screen
- Hierarchical table of contents with drill-down navigation: Enter to open categories, Backspace to go back
- Article content mode with paragraph-by-paragraph reading (Up/Down arrows)
- Credits mode with sequential navigation
- Categories announced as "section" to distinguish from articles
- Embedded card displays filtered from content paragraphs
- Standalone buttons (Replay Tutorial, Credits) included in TOC
- Navigation stack preserves position when drilling in and out of categories
- Files: CodexNavigator.cs

### New: Localized UI Roles
- Element roles (button, toggle, dropdown, slider, input field) now announced in the game's language
- Button role suppressed outside tutorial mode to reduce announcement verbosity
- All role label construction centralized through `BuildLabel` method
- Files: UIElementClassifier.cs, BaseNavigator.cs, Strings.cs, lang/*.json

### New: Navbar Currency and Wildcard Labels
- Gold, Gems, and Wildcards buttons in the navigation bar now have accessible labels with current counts
- Nav_WildCard element shown in deck builder and booster pack screens for quick wildcard count access
- Files: UIElementClassifier.cs, GeneralMenuNavigator.cs

### New: FallbackLabels for Unlabeled Buttons
- Centralized fallback label mapping gives consistent names to buttons that have no text or tooltip
- Covers installer, challenge screen, and other unlabeled UI elements
- Files: UIElementClassifier.cs

### Fix: Dropdown Display and Caption Reading
- Dropdown caption text now read directly from `m_CaptionText` field instead of `options[value]` (fixes stale/wrong display)
- Stale dropdown value correction attempts to match displayed value to actual game state on navigation
- Transient focus during dropdown label refresh no longer triggers false announcements
- Files: DropdownStateManager.cs, BaseNavigator.cs, UIElementClassifier.cs

### Fix: Slider and Stepper Value Refresh
- Slider and stepper values now update correctly when navigating between them
- Unity handles slider step changes directly instead of mod intercepting
- Files: BaseNavigator.cs

### Fix: Backspace Not Exiting Collection/Deck Builder
- Backspace now properly exits collection and deck builder screens when no in-screen back button is found
- Files: GeneralMenuNavigator.cs

### Fix: Duel Settings Menu Interactions
- Fixed duel state not resetting correctly after closing the settings menu mid-game
- Fixed Enter key inadvertently opening the settings menu during duels
- Files: DuelNavigator.cs, SettingsMenuNavigator.cs

### Improved: Installer Button Labels
- Installer buttons now have clearer, more descriptive labels
- Files: Installer

## v0.7.3-dev

### New: Invalid Deck Status in Deck Picker
- Deck announcements now include validity status: "invalid deck", "N invalid cards", "missing cards", "missing cards, craftable", "invalid companion", or "unavailable"
- Press Right arrow on an invalid deck to hear the detailed reason (localized tooltip with banned card counts, wildcard costs, companion issues, etc.)
- Reads DeckView's pre-computed validation state and tooltip text directly — no scene scanning or i18n keyword matching
- Files: UIActivator.cs, GeneralMenuNavigator.cs, BaseNavigator.cs

### New: Multi-Zone Browser Support (First Iteration)
- Cards that select from multiple zones (e.g., Kronleuchter targeting both graveyards) now have navigable zone selection
- Up/Down arrows cycle between zones, Tab moves to cards, Shift+Tab returns to zone selector
- Zone buttons with real localized names (e.g., "Dein Friedhof", "Friedhof des Gegners") are included; generic unnamed zones are filtered out
- False positive multi-zone scaffolds (e.g., Tiefste Epoche selecting from a single zone) are correctly detected and treated as single-zone browsers
- Invisible scaffold layout buttons (SingleButton, 2Button_Left/Right) filtered via shared IsVisibleViaCanvasGroup check
- CardInfoNavigator deactivated while on zone selector to prevent arrow key conflicts
- Files: BrowserNavigator.cs, HotHighlightNavigator.cs

### Fixed: Input Fields in Popups
- Input fields in popups (e.g., invite friend, challenge invite) now use the same full implementation as menu navigators
- Arrow Up/Down reads field content, Left/Right reads character at cursor, Backspace announces deleted character
- Tab navigates to next/previous popup item (consumed properly, no longer leaks to game)
- Legacy Unity InputField support added alongside TMP_InputField
- Shared `InputFieldEditHelper` class eliminates code duplication between BaseNavigator and PopupHandler
- Files: InputFieldEditHelper.cs (new), PopupHandler.cs, BaseNavigator.cs

### Fixed: Localize Mana Colors and Action Strings
- Mana color names (White, Blue, Black, Red, Green, Colorless, Snow, etc.) now use locale keys instead of hardcoded English
- Hybrid mana (e.g., "White or Blue") and Phyrexian mana use localized format strings
- "Activated" and "selected" announcements now use locale keys
- Color filter toggle labels in deck builder are now localized
- Added new locale keys: ManaGeneric, ManaPhyrexian (bare), Activated (bare)
- Updated: CardDetector.cs, CardModelProvider.cs, StoreNavigator.cs, UIActivator.cs, DraftNavigator.cs, GeneralMenuNavigator.cs, UIElementClassifier.cs

### Changed: Announcement Order
- Item count and position are now read last instead of first in all menu and screen announcements
- Content (label, hints, instructions) is announced before "X of Y" position info
- Updated across all navigators and all 12 locale files

### New: Extended Card Info (I Key) in All Screens
- The I key now works outside of duels — in deck builder, collection, store, draft, and other card screens
- Shows individual ability texts as separate navigable items (Up/Down to cycle)
- Extracts abilities from card model directly when duel-only AbilityHangerProvider is unavailable
- Files: BaseNavigator.cs, CardModelProvider.cs

### Improved: Challenge Screen Accessibility
- Main button now includes challenge status text (e.g., waiting for opponent)
- Polls for opponent join/leave and status text changes at 1-second intervals
- Detects match countdown start/cancel from status text
- Icon-only enemy buttons labeled: Kick, Block, Add Friend
- Spinners prefixed with "Locked" when settings are controlled by host
- Tournament parameters announced after mode spinner change
- Files: ChallengeNavigationHelper.cs, GeneralMenuNavigator.cs

### Fixed: Popup Leaving State
- Fixed getting stuck on empty screen after pressing buttons in popups that trigger server actions (e.g., sending invite with invalid name)
- Popup validation now checks if popup GameObject still exists before consuming input
- Uses `HandleEarlyInput()` hook to route popup input before BaseNavigator's auto-focus logic can intercept it
- Files: BaseNavigator.cs, GeneralMenuNavigator.cs, SettingsMenuNavigator.cs

### Fixed: Friends Panel Add Friend/Challenge Labels
- FriendsWidget action buttons now prefer localized tooltip/locale text instead of cleaned GameObject names
- `Button_AddFriend` and `Button_AddChallenge` now resolve to locale keys when no direct label text is present
- Tooltip fallback now checks parent containers so hitbox children can use their parent `TooltipTrigger` localization
- Files: UITextExtractor.cs

## v0.7.2 - 2026-02-26

### New: Land Summary Shortcut (M / Shift+M)
- Press **M** to hear a summary of your lands: total count and untapped lands grouped by name
- Press **Shift+M** for the opponent's land summary
- Example announcements: "7 lands, 2 Island, 1 Mountain, 1 Azorius Gate untapped" or "5 lands, all tapped"
- Uses existing battlefield land rows and tap state detection
- Files: BattlefieldNavigator.cs, DuelNavigator.cs, InputManager.cs, Strings.cs, HelpNavigator.cs, en.json

### Fixed: Card Type Lines Now Correctly Localized
- Card type lines (e.g. "Legendary Creature - Elf Warrior") now display in the game's selected language instead of always showing English
- Uses `TypeTextId`/`SubtypeTextId` localization IDs via `GreLocProvider`, same system used for flavor text
- Applies to all card contexts: duel, deck builder, collection, store, booster opening, rewards, drafts, other card faces
- Files: CardModelProvider.cs, HotHighlightNavigator.cs, UIActivator.cs

### Improved: Card Name Localization
- Card names now use `TitleId` via `GreLocProvider` as primary lookup to avoid cases where names could appear in English while other card text was correctly localized
- Falls back to previous `CardTitleProvider` lookup when `TitleId` is not available
- Files: CardModelProvider.cs

### New: Deck Builder Sideboard Group
- Pool holder cards (available cards to add) are now classified as **Sideboard** instead of **Collection** when editing a deck. Applies to draft, sealed, and normal deck builder.
- New `DeckBuilderSideboard` group with "Sideboard" label (Tab-cyclable between Collection, Sideboard, Deck List, Deck Info, Filters)
- Sideboard cards use quantity-prefixed labels ("1x Card Name") matching deck list format
- Card detail navigation (Up/Down) works for sideboard cards
- Files: ElementGroup.cs, ElementGroupAssigner.cs, GroupedNavigator.cs, GeneralMenuNavigator.cs, CardModelProvider.cs, CardDetector.cs, Strings.cs, en.json, de.json

### Fixed: Single-Card Groups Shown as Standalone Items
- Deck builder card groups (Collection, Sideboard, Deck List) now always appear as proper groups even when they contain only 1 card
- Previously a single card would appear as a standalone item in the list without the group name, losing context about which section it belongs to
- Files: ElementGroup.cs, GroupedNavigator.cs

### Improved: PopupHandler Rework
- **Input field support**: Popups with input fields (e.g., InviteFriendPopup, ChallengeInviteWindow) are now fully navigable. Enter activates edit mode, Escape exits, Tab navigates to next item, Up/Down reads content, Left/Right reads character at cursor, Backspace announces deleted character.
- **Button filtering**: Dismiss overlays (background, overlay, backdrop, dismiss) automatically filtered. Duplicate button labels deduplicated. Buttons nested inside input fields or other buttons skipped.
- **Text block filtering**: Text inside input fields (placeholder, typed text) no longer appears as separate text blocks.
- **Rescan suppression**: GeneralMenuNavigator's delayed rescan (0.5s) now skips while popup is active, preventing PopupHandler's items from being overwritten.
- Files: PopupHandler.cs, GeneralMenuNavigator.cs

### New: Full Control Toggle (P / Shift+P)
- P key toggles temporary full control (resets on phase change)
- Shift+P toggles locked full control (permanent until toggled off)
- Announces "Full control on/off" and "Full control locked/unlocked"
- Uses GameManager.AutoRespManager reflection for toggle and state read

### New: Phase Stop Hotkeys (1-0)
- Number keys 1-0 toggle phase stops during duels
- 1=Upkeep, 2=Draw, 3=First Main, 4=Begin Combat, 5=Declare Attackers, 6=Declare Blockers, 7=Combat Damage, 8=End Combat, 9=Second Main, 0=End Step
- Announces "[Phase] stop set" / "[Phase] stop cleared" with localized phase names
- Note: Phase stops are "also stop here" markers. The game still stops at any phase where you have playable actions (this is standard MTGA behavior, not a mod limitation). Phase stops ensure the game also stops at the marked phase even when you have nothing to play.
- Ctrl key blocked from reaching the game in duels (prevents accidental full control toggle when silencing NVDA with Ctrl)
- Files: PriorityController.cs, DuelNavigator.cs, KeyboardManagerPatch.cs

### Fixed: End Step Phase Not Announced
- End step was never announced during duels
- Game sends `Ending/None` for the end step, but code checked for `Ending/End` which never occurs
- Without the match, the debounce timer from Second Main Phase would fire instead, incorrectly announcing "Second main phase" even when the game stopped at the end step
- Fix: Match `Ending/None` as the end step event

### New: Event System Accessibility
- Event tiles on Play Blade enriched with title, ranked/Bo3 indicators, progress pips, and in-progress status
- Event page shows "Event: {title}" with win progress summary
- Improved reading of event informational text (description, rules, rewards)
- Jump In packet selection fully navigable: Up/Down for packets, Left/Right for info blocks (name, colors, description)
- Packet activation via reflection (ClickPacket) since UIActivator can't reach PacketInput on parent GO
- Confirm button and rescan after packet selection/confirmation for async GO rebuilds
- Tested with Jump Start, Starter Duel, and Draft events
- EventAccessor static class for all reflection-based event/packet data access

### New: Draft Navigator
- Full keyboard navigation for the draft card picking screen
- Navigate available cards, select picks with Enter
- Draft popup handling for pack transitions
- Files: DraftNavigator.cs

### New: OptionalAction Browser Navigation
- Shockland-style choice prompts (e.g. "Pay 2 life?") now navigable as a browser
- Tab to navigate options, Enter to select
- Files: BrowserNavigator.cs

### Fixed: Player Target Selection (Enter Key)
- Enter on player targets (e.g. "Choose a player to draw two cards") was activating a hand card instead of selecting the player
- Root cause: HotHighlightNavigator didn't claim zone ownership when navigating to player/button targets
- Now properly claims ownership so Enter activates the correct target

## v0.7.1 - 2026-02-23

### New: Damage Assignment Browser
- Full keyboard navigation for the damage assignment browser (when your attacker is blocked by multiple creatures)
- Up/Down arrows adjust damage spinner on current blocker
- Left/Right arrows navigate between blockers
- Each blocker announced with name, P/T, current damage assigned, and lethal status
- Entry announcement: "Assign damage. [AttackerName], [Power] damage. [N] blockers"
- Lethal damage indicated when spinner value text turns gold
- Space submits damage assignment (via DoneAction reflection)
- Backspace undoes last assignment (via UndoAction reflection)
- Multiple damage assigners in one combat announced as "X of Y"
- Total damage cached from workflow's MtgDamageAssigner struct

### New: Library Zone Navigation
- D key navigates your library, Shift+D for opponent's library
- Only shows cards visible to sighted players (anti-cheat protection):
  - Cards with HotHighlight (playable from library via Future Sight, Vizier of the Menagerie, etc.)
  - Cards displayed face-up (revealed by Courser of Kruphix, Experimental Frenzy, etc.)
  - Hidden face-down cards are never exposed
- If no revealed/playable cards exist, announces library count without entering navigation
- Left/Right navigates revealed cards, Enter plays playable cards via two-click
- Full card info via Up/Down arrows on revealed library cards
- Uses `IsDisplayedFaceDown` model property for reliable reveal detection

### New: Read-Only Deck Builder Accessibility
- Starter and precon decks now navigable when opened in read-only mode
- Cards listed with quantity and name (e.g. "2x Lightning Bolt")
- Up/Down card details work on read-only deck cards
- Enter on a card announces "This deck is read only. To edit, open it from My Decks."
- Screen announces "Deck Builder, Read Only" to distinguish from editable mode
- Back button (Backspace) works as expected to return to deck list

### Fixed: Stale Combat Button During Blockers Phase
- Combat prompt button was showing stale text after blocker assignment

### Fixed: Duplicate Entries in Incoming Friend Requests
- Sub-buttons (accept/reject) inside InviteIncomingTile were registered as separate navigable entries
- One friend request appeared as 3 identical entries instead of 1

### Fixed: Home Screen Carousel Navigation Broken by Group System
- Left/Right arrow keys on the promotional carousel stopped working after grouped navigation was introduced
- Standalone Content groups (like the carousel) are navigated at GroupList level where `CurrentElement` returns null
- `HandleCarouselArrow` now checks `IsCurrentGroupStandalone` to find the element directly from the group

### Fixed: Carousel and Navbar Buttons Showing Raw GO Names Instead of Content
- Promotional carousel banner showed "Banner Left" instead of actual content text (e.g., "Du kannst es kaum erwarten...")
- Root cause: `MaxLabelLength` was 80, banner text was 83 chars - just over the limit. Increased to 120.
- Image-only navbar buttons (Nav_Settings, Nav_Learn) showed cleaned GO names ("nav settings", "nav learn")
- Added `TryGetTooltipText()` fallback in `UITextExtractor` that reads `LocString` from `TooltipTrigger` via reflection
- Now shows localized labels: "Optionen anpassen", "Kodex des Multiversums"

## v0.7.0 - 2026-02-23

### New: Friends Panel Navigation
- Full keyboard navigation for the friends/social panel
- Hierarchical groups: Friends, Incoming Requests, Sent Requests, Blocked
- Per-friend actions: Challenge, Chat, Unfriend, Block, Accept, Decline, Revoke, Unblock
- Your Profile section with full username display
- Blocked users section forced open for accessibility

### New: Challenge Screen
- Dedicated ChallengeMain navigator for direct challenge setup
- Popout stepper navigation for format/scene/timer options (Left/Right to cycle)
- Deck selection via PlayBlade-style grouped navigation with folder support
- Player status announcements (invited, waiting, deck selected)
- Invite and Leave buttons with proper state tracking across spinner changes

### New: Command Zone Shortcuts
- W key to navigate your command zone (commander/companion)
- Shift+W for opponent's command zone
- Full card details for opponent's commander
- Commander filtered from mulligan hand display

### New: Origin Zone Display
- Cards playable from non-hand zones now show their origin (e.g. "Lightning Bolt, from graveyard")
- Works for flashback, escape, commander, and similar mechanics

### Improved: Card State Change Announcements
- Pressing Enter on a battlefield card announces the resulting state change (e.g. "attacking", "selected")
- Per-frame watcher detects combat and selection state changes reliably
- Blocker assignment on an attacker now announces just "blocked by Angel" instead of redundant "attacking, blocked by Angel"
- Works for attack/block selection, and non-combat selection (sacrifice, exile)

### Improved: Selection Mode Announcements (Discard, Exile, etc.)
- Toggle announcement now shows progress: "CardName, 1 of 2 selected"
- Deselecting a card says: "CardName deselected, 0 of 2 selected"
- Required count read from game's prompt text (e.g. "Discard 2 cards")
- Number word parsing for languages that spell out numbers (e.g. "zwei" in German)
- NumberWords mappings in language files - contributors can fix their language without code changes

### Improved: Combat Announcements
- Attacker selection detected via SelectedHighlightBattlefield during declare attackers phase
- Delayed attack eligibility now uses model-based fallback for newly created tokens
- Blocker deselection and unassignment announced with card name and "can block" state
- Blocker P/T announcement no longer includes redundant "blocking" word

### Improved: Duel Performance
- Cached reflection lookups for card model access (fields, properties, methods)
- Shared DuelHolderCache for zone and battlefield holder lookups, replacing per-frame FindObjectsOfType scans
- Compiled regex patterns for highlight discovery
- Precise battlefield click positions using card screen coordinates to avoid hitting wrong overlapping tokens

### Fixed: Store and Mastery Backspace Not Returning Home
- Store tab-level Backspace now navigates home instead of silently deactivating
- Mastery screen Backspace falls back to home navigation when no in-screen back button is found
- Moved `NavigateToHome()` to BaseNavigator as shared utility for all navigators
- Bug originally reported and fix approach contributed by **@blindndangerous** (PR #1)

### Fixed
- German "milled" translation corrected from "wird gemahlen" to "wird gemillt"
- Deck builder popups now auto-enter Dialog group when opened
- Challenge invite popup navigation with per-navigator popup tracking
- Input field tutorial hint added and text field labels localized
- General duel commands section added to help menu (F1)

### Installer
- MelonLoader console window hidden by default during installation
- Unified version management via Directory.Build.props

## v0.6.9 - 2026-02-19

### New: Mana Color Picker Navigator
- Detects `ManaColorSelector` popup when activating any-color mana sources (e.g. Ilysian Caryatid, Chromatic Lantern)
- Announces available colors on open: "Choose mana color: 1 White, 2 Blue, 3 Black, 4 Red, 5 Green"
- Tab/Right and Shift+Tab/Left to navigate colors, Enter to select
- Number keys 1-6 for direct selection
- Backspace to cancel
- Multi-pick support for sources that produce multiple mana (sequential picks with re-announcement)
- Highest priority in DuelNavigator (before browser detection)
- Localized in all 12 languages

### Fixed: Duel Navigator Not Reactivating After Settings Menu
- Opening the game settings during a duel and closing it left the user with no active navigator
- Cause: `HasPreGameCancelButton()` matched the in-duel Cancel button, blocking duel re-detection
- Removed the redundant check; `HasDuelElements()` alone correctly distinguishes pre-game from duel

### Improved: Selection Mode (Discard, Exile Choices)
- Zone navigation (C + Left/Right + Enter) now toggles card selection instead of trying to play
- Selected state shown when navigating hand via zone shortcuts, not just Tab
- Game's prompt instruction announced on selection mode entry (e.g. "Discard a card")
- Tab index preserved after toggling so next Tab advances to next card
- Space submits selection even when hand cards are highlighted

### Fixed: Zone Contents Not Updating During Duels
- Zone card lists (hand, battlefield, graveyard, etc.) now refresh automatically when cards enter or leave
- Uses event-driven dirty flag: DuelAnnouncer marks navigators dirty on zone count changes
- Refresh is lazy (only on next user input), so no polling overhead
- Card index clamped after refresh to keep user at a valid position

### Installer: Open Getting Started Guide After Install
- New checkbox on the installer completion screen: "Open getting started guide in browser" (checked by default)
- Opens the README on GitHub in the user's language automatically
- English users get README.md, other languages get docs/README.{lang}.md

### Translated README Files
- Added translated README for all 11 non-English languages in docs/
- German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese (BR), Japanese, Korean, Russian, Polish, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional
- Full translation of installation guide, keyboard shortcuts, troubleshooting, and build instructions

### Improved: Unified Zone Announcements
- Zone/row entry now uses single announcement: "Hand, Lightning Bolt, 1 of 3" instead of separate "Hand, 3 cards" + "Lightning Bolt, 1 of 3"
- Tab navigation syncs with zone and battlefield navigators so Left/Right works correctly after Tab
- Tab to a card in a different zone triggers a proper zone change announcement
- Tab within the same zone announces just the card and position

### Improved: Dropdown Select and Close
- Enter on a dropdown item now selects it and closes the dropdown in one action
- Previously required Enter to select, then Escape/Backspace to close
- Closed dropdown displays current selected value (e.g. "Monat der Geburt: Januar, dropdown")
- Dynamic value re-read via GetDropdownDisplayValue handles TMP_Dropdown, Dropdown, and cTMP_Dropdown

### Fixed: ViewDismiss Browser Trapping Focus
- Pressing Enter on graveyard/exile cards opened a ViewDismiss card preview popup
- The popup trapped keyboard focus, leaving the user stuck with no way to dismiss
- Backspace/Space would accidentally click combat buttons (e.g. "No Attacks", "Cancel Blocks") instead of dismissing
- Root cause: "Dismiss" was missing from BrowserDetector's CancelPatterns, and PromptButton fallback hit combat buttons
- Fix: BrowserNavigator now auto-dismisses ViewDismiss popups immediately on detection via UIActivator.Activate()

### Other
- Added Wizards account creation link to README quick start section
- Added first letter navigation and rapid key-hold navigation to planned features

## v0.6.8 - 2026-02-19

### Fixed: Dropdown Navigation Overhaul
- Enter now selects dropdown items without closing the dropdown, keeping user in control
- Tab navigates between form elements in mod list order (matching arrow keys)
- Tabbing to a closed dropdown auto-opens it (screen reader standard)
- Tabbing from inside an open dropdown closes it silently and moves to next element
- Fixed registration page auto-advancing when opening the last required dropdown (Experience)
  - Game's cTMP_Dropdown fires onValueChanged on item focus, triggering premature form validation
  - DropdownStateManager now suppresses onValueChanged while dropdown is open
- Fixed dropdown-to-dropdown chain auto-advance on registration page
  - Submit events blocked for a few frames after dropdown selection
  - Auto-opened dropdowns detected and closed
- Enter/Submit blocked from reaching the game while in dropdown mode
- Selection sets value silently via reflection (bypasses onValueChanged)
- German translations: changed "Aufklappmenü" to "Dropdown" for consistency

### Fixed: UIActivator Double-Activation
- SimulatePointerClick was firing 3-4 overlapping activation methods per button press
- Now only the core pointer sequence fires
- Removed redundant TryInvokeCustomButtonOnClick after SimulatePointerClick
- Fixes NPE tutorial match failing to start on first press

### Fixed: Input Field Arrow Key Navigation
- Up/Down arrows no longer exit input field edit mode on single-line fields (registration, login)
- Unity's TMP_InputField treats Up/Down as "finish editing" in single-line mode via OnUpdateSelected, which runs before our code
- IsEditingInputField() now uses explicit edit mode flag instead of checking isFocused
- ReactivateInputField() restores field focus after Up/Down deactivation
- EventSystemPatch blocks SendMoveEventToSelectedObject during edit mode as defense-in-depth

### Other
- Added untested items to known issues: events, friends/direct challenge

## v0.6.7 - 2026-02-18

### New: Bot Match via PlayBlade
- Bot Match now accessible: Open Play → Bot-Match → select deck → Play starts a bot match
- Harmony prefix patch on `JoinMatchMaking` replaces event name with "AIBotMatch" when Bot-Match mode selected
- Bot-Match mode detected by checking element text for "Bot" on PlayBladeContent activation
- Flag auto-clears after match start and when PlayBlade closes

### New: PlayBlade Queue Type Tabs
- Replaced "Find Match" tab with three queue type tabs: Ranked, Open Play, Brawl
- Queue types appear at the same level as Events and Recent for flatter navigation
- Virtual entries injected when FindMatch is not active, real tabs used when active
- Two-step activation for virtual entries (clicks FindMatch tab, then queue type tab)
- Backspace from content returns to tabs, landing on the queue type entry
- BO3 toggle now labeled "Best of 3" (was showing "POSITION" placeholder)
- FindMatch nav tab, Play button, and New Deck button excluded from blade navigation

### New: Card Rarity Info Block
- Cards now display rarity as a navigable info block (Arrow Up/Down)
- Shown between Flavor Text and Artist in card details
- Values: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Mythic Rare, Land
- Works in all contexts: collection, deck builder, duel, store
- Localized label for all 12 supported languages

### New: Brief Cast Announcements Setting (untested)
- New setting to shorten cast announcements for your own spells

### New: NPE Deck Reward Screen Support (untested)
- NPERewardNavigator now handles deck box rewards after completing all 5 NPE tutorial stages
- Detects deck prefabs (children with `Hitbox_LidOpen`) when no card prefabs are found
- Left/Right navigates between deck boxes, Enter opens them
- Deck names extracted via UITextExtractor with fallback to "Deck 1", "Deck 2", etc.
- Localized "Decks Unlocked" screen name for all 12 languages

### Bug Fix: PlayBlade Auto-Play After Deck Selection
- Fixed auto-press Play button failing silently after deck selection
- Root cause: MainButton was classified as Unknown and excluded from navigator elements
- Fix: Search scene directly via FindObjectsOfType instead of iterating navigator elements

### Bug Fix: Selected Cards Disappearing in Selection Mode (untested)
- Fixed selected cards disappearing from Tab navigation in selection mode

### Bug Fix: German Translation Issues
- Fixed incorrect German translation strings

### Other
- README, license, and project cleanup for public beta

## v0.6.6 - 2026-02-17

### Bug Fix: Single-Item List Navigation
- Fixed: Up/Down navigation on menus/screens with only one entry would say "Beginning/End of list" without reading the entry, or say nothing at all
- Now re-announces the single entry before the boundary announcement
- Affects all navigator types: grouped menus, extended card info (I), help (F1), settings (F2)

### New: Navigable Extended Card Info (I Key)
- I key now opens a navigable modal menu instead of a one-shot announcement
- Each keyword description is a separate navigable entry (e.g., "Flying: This creature can't be blocked...")
- Linked face info split into individual entries (name, mana cost, type, P/T, rules text)
- Navigate with Up/Down arrows, Home/End to jump, close with I/Backspace/Escape
- Blocks all other input while open (same as F1 Help and F2 Settings)
- "No additional information" announced without opening menu when card has no extended info
- "No card selected to inspect" when no card is focused

### Mod Improvements
- Launch announcement now shows "Accessible Arena v0.6.6 launched" instead of generic "MTGA Accessibility Mod loaded"
- MelonInfo version updated from placeholder to actual release version

### Installer: Full Localization (12 Languages)
- All user-facing installer strings are now localized
- InstallerLocale static class loads embedded JSON resources with fallback chain (active -> English -> key name)
- Language auto-detected from OS, changeable live in welcome wizard
- Supported: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese (BR), Russian, Polish, Japanese, Korean, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional

### Installer: Two-Page Welcome Wizard
- Page 1: Welcome message, mod version to install, language selector, Next button
- Page 2: MTGA download links (Direct Download + Download Page), Back and Install buttons

### Installer: Version Detection Fixes
- Installed version now read from registry first (stores GitHub release tag), falling back to DLL assembly version
- Prevents perpetual "update available" when DLL has stale assembly version
- New "Mod Up to Date" dialog when mod is current (shows version, offers Close or Full Reinstall)
- Removed redundant version check in MainForm after user already confirmed action
- Update mode now correctly fetches latest version from GitHub for registry storage

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions workflow now patches MelonInfo version from git tag via `sed` before building
- Ensures runtime `Info.Version` always matches the release tag alongside the assembly version

---

## v0.6.5 - 2026-02-17

### New: Full Localization System
- Added JSON-based localization with 12 languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese (BR), Japanese, Korean, Russian, Polish, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional
- All ~630 user-facing strings are now localizable, including all duel announcements, zone names, combat states, card relationships, phase names, browser types, and UI messages
- `Strings.cs` centralized accessor with properties and helper methods (`GetPhaseDescription`, `GetFriendlyBrowserName`, `GetZoneName`, `GetRowName`)
- Locale JSON files embedded in DLL for self-contained deployment - extracted to `UserData/AccessibleArena/lang/` on startup
- Fallback chain: active language -> English -> key name (never shows blank text)
- Pluralization support: OneOther (Western), Slavic 3-form (Russian/Polish), NoPluralForm (CJK)

### New: Mod Settings Menu (F2)
- Persistent settings menu accessible in all scenes including duels
- Language picker with dropdown-style cycling through all 12 languages
- Tutorial Messages toggle (On/Off) - controls keyboard hints appended to activation announcements
- Verbose Announcements toggle (On/Off) - controls extra detail like counts and positions
- Settings persist to `UserData/AccessibleArena/settings.json`
- Arrow Up/Down to navigate, Enter to change, Backspace or F2 to close

### Bug Fixes
- Escape now closes Help (F1) and Settings (F2) menus and is blocked from reaching the game while mod menus are open
- Fix false "Rewards" screen name announced during scene transitions
- Reduce NPEReward detection log spam to only log on state changes

### Documentation
- Added translation contribution guide with full string reference for all ~630 keys
- Updated LOCALIZATION.md, MOD_STRUCTURE.md, and GAME_ARCHITECTURE.md with localization system details

## v0.6 - 2026-02-14

### New Navigator: StoreNavigator
- Dedicated navigator for the Store screen (priority 55)
- Two-level navigation: tabs (Up/Down) and items within tabs (Up/Down after Enter)
- Left/Right cycles purchase options on store items (gems, gold, real money)
- Details view for deck/bundle items with navigable card list (Left/Right for cards, Up/Down for info blocks)
- Store item descriptions extracted from active tag text (discount badges, timers, limits, callouts)
- Confirmation modal handled as popup with Cancel option and proper button discovery via reflection
- Utility elements at tab level: payment method, redeem code, drop rates
- Pack progress info (goal count, description) shown as utility element
- GeneralMenuNavigator suppressed when store is active

### New: WebBrowserAccessibility
- Keyboard navigation for embedded ZFBrowser popups (Xsolla payment dialogs)
- Extracts page elements via JavaScript (EvalJSCSP to bypass CSP restrictions), recursively scans iframes
- Up/Down navigates elements, Enter activates buttons/links, Tab/Shift+Tab for form fields
- Text input support with 3-tier fallback: execCommand, keyboard events per char, direct value set
- Left/Right reads character-by-character in edit mode, Enter/Escape to start/stop editing
- PayPal CAPTCHA detection after 3 empty rescans with warning announcement
- Escape blocked from game while web browser is active
- Loading state detection via IsReady, delayed rescan after button clicks for slow page transitions
- Label detection: wrapping labels, preceding siblings, parent sibling labels, name attribute fallback
- Deduplicated repeated text elements

### New Navigator: MasteryNavigator
- Dedicated navigator for the Mastery/Rewards screen (priority 60)
- Replaces GeneralMenuNavigator's unusable 55-group flat list with structured level navigation
- Up/Down navigates mastery levels with reward name and completion status announced
- Left/Right cycles between reward tiers within a level (Free, Premium, Renewal)
- Virtual status item at position 0 with XP progress info and action buttons as tiers
- PageUp/PageDown jumps ~10 levels, Home/End jumps to status item/last level
- Enter on a level announces detailed info (all tiers, quantities, status)
- Backspace returns to Home screen
- Automatic page sync when navigating past page boundaries
- PrizeWall mode: "Mastery Tree" opens sphere-spending navigator with item navigation and purchase confirmation
- Level completion derived from game's `SetMasteryDataProvider.GetCurrentLevelIndex()` via reflection
- Reward names resolved via `MTGALocalizedString` localization system

### DeckManager Improvements
- Deck-specific toolbar buttons (Edit, Delete, Export, Favorite, Clone, Deck Details) hidden from top-level navigation
- These actions now only accessible via Right Arrow actions menu on each deck entry (expanded from 4 to 7 actions)
- Standalone buttons (Import, Collection) remain visible at top level

### Bug Fixes
- Fix tapped state not displayed for some battlefield cards
  - Was using unreliable UI scan for TappedIcon child element which the game doesn't render consistently
  - Now reads IsTapped field directly from game model via reflection (authoritative source)
- Exclude PackProgressMeter from panel detection (inherits PopupBase but isn't a real popup, was blocking payment popup detection)

---

## v0.5.1 - 2026-02-11

### Bug Fixes
- Fix card navigator staying active when opening settings menu during duel
  - Previously, pressing Escape with a card focused left CardInfoNavigator active
  - Up/Down arrows in settings would announce card details instead of navigating menu items
  - Now detects navigator transitions and deactivates CardInfoNavigator on switch
- Fix matchmaking cancel button not wired to Backspace shortcut
  - `_cancelButton` was never set in `DiscoverMatchmakingElements`, so Backspace did nothing

### Loading Screen Cleanup
- Removed Cancel and Settings buttons from loading screen navigation lists
  - Cancel accessible via Backspace, Settings via Escape — no need to navigate to them
  - Applies to MatchEnd, PreGame, and Matchmaking screens
  - Button references kept internally for shortcut functionality

---

## v0.5 - 2026-02-11

### Ctrl+Tab: Cycle Opponent Targets
- Ctrl+Tab cycles through only opponent targets during targeting (skips your own cards)
- Ctrl+Shift+Tab cycles opponent targets in reverse
- Does nothing silently when no opponent targets are highlighted
- Files: `HotHighlightNavigator.cs`

### Combat Cleanup
- Removed F key shortcut from combat phases (was redundant alias for Space)
- Space is now the only key for confirming attackers/blockers
- Removed experimental cancel-skip code from HotHighlightNavigator (mana payment handled by workflow browser)
- Removed commented-out Backspace handler from HotHighlightNavigator
- Files: `CombatNavigator.cs`, `HotHighlightNavigator.cs`, `Strings.cs`, `HelpNavigator.cs`

### Phase Announcement Debounce
- Added 100ms debounce to phase announcements to prevent spam during auto-skip
- When the game rapidly skips through phases (combat/ending/beginning), only the final phase is announced
- Previously auto-skip produced up to 6 rapid announcements ("Combat phase, Declare attackers, End of combat, Second main phase, First main phase")
- Now only the phase where the game actually stops is spoken (e.g., "First main phase")
- Attacker summary announcements bypass debounce (real combat stops, not auto-skip)
- Added Upkeep and Draw as announced phases (debounced away during auto-skip, announced when game gives priority)
- Files: `DuelAnnouncer.cs`, `DuelNavigator.cs`

### Player Info Zone: Emotes and Rank Fix
- Emote wheel now opens correctly via PortraitButton click on DuelScene_AvatarView (was clicking MatchTimer HoverArea which doesn't trigger emotes)
- Emote buttons discovered from EmoteView children (custom click handlers, not standard UI.Button)
- Player rank now reads from GameManager.MatchManager player info via reflection instead of searching for nonexistent text in RankAnchorPoint sprite
- Rank displayed as "Bronze Tier 2", "Mythic #1234", "Mythic 95%", or "Unranked"
- Player zone focus element uses PortraitButton.gameObject instead of timer HoverArea
- Removed dead code: FindCurrentPlayerAvatar, HasPlayerTargetingHighlight, IsChildOfEmoteView
- Files: `PlayerPortraitNavigator.cs`

### Player Targeting Fix
- Spells that can target players (e.g., Cracked Blitz, Lightning Bolt) now correctly discover player avatars as valid targets
- Previous approach searched for HotHighlight children on MatchTimer objects, which the game never adds
- New approach reads `DuelScene_AvatarView.HighlightSystem._currentHighlightType` via reflection
- Accepts Hot (3), Tepid (2), and Cold (1) highlight values as valid targets
- Click activates `PortraitButton` (private SerializeField) which triggers the same click path as a mouse click
- Files: `HotHighlightNavigator.cs`

### Targeting/Targeted-By Announcements
- Stack spells now announce their targets: "Lightning Bolt, targeting Grizzly Bears, 1 of 2"
- Battlefield cards announce what's targeting them: "Grizzly Bears, targeted by Lightning Bolt, 1 of 3"
- Multiple targets supported: "targeting Angel and Dragon"
- Resolves names from both battlefield and stack zones
- Uses `Model.Instance.TargetIds` / `TargetedByIds` fields via reflection
- Files: `CardModelProvider.cs`, `BattlefieldNavigator.cs`, `ZoneNavigator.cs`

### LargeScrollList Browser Choice Discovery
- Keyword choice browsers (e.g. Entstellender Künstler with 3+ choices) now discover actual choice buttons
- Previously only scaffold controls (2Button_Left, MainButton, etc.) were found because choice buttons don't match standard ButtonPatterns
- New `DiscoverLargeScrollListChoices` scans for all clickable elements that aren't standard scaffold buttons
- Also used by `SelectNCounters` scaffold for color selection (SelectColorWorkflow) - see v0.7.4 fix
- Choices ordered first in Tab navigation, scaffold controls last
- Files: `BrowserNavigator.cs`

### Blocker-Attacker Relationship Announcements
- Assigned blockers now announce what they're blocking: "Cat blocking Angel" instead of "Cat assigned"
- Navigating a blocker shows attacker name: "Cat, blocking Angel, 2 of 5"
- Navigating a blocked attacker shows blockers: "Angel, attacking, blocked by Cat, 3 of 5"
- Unblocked attackers unchanged: "Angel, attacking, 3 of 5"
- Uses `Model.Instance.BlockingIds` / `BlockedByIds` fields to resolve combat relationships
- Combat detection now model-first (`CardModelProvider.GetIsAttackingFromCard/GetIsBlockingFromCard`) with UI fallback
- New helpers in `CardModelProvider`: `GetBlockingIds`, `GetBlockedByIds`, `ResolveInstanceIdToName`
- Refactored `GetModelInstance` as shared cached helper (also used by `GetAttachedToId`)
- Files: `CardModelProvider.cs`, `CombatNavigator.cs`

### Attachment/Enchantment Announcements
- Battlefield cards now announce attachments: "Grizzly Bears, enchanted by Pacifism"
- Auras/equipment announce their target: "Pacifism, attached to Grizzly Bears"
- DuelAnnouncer announces enchantment resolution: "Pacifism enchanted Grizzly Bears"
- Uses `Model.Instance.AttachedToId` field on `MtgCardInstance` (discovered via decompiling `UniversalBattlefieldStack`)
- Files: `CardModelProvider.cs`, `DuelAnnouncer.cs`

### Recent Tab (Kürzlich gespielt) Improvements
- Deck labels enriched with event/mode name (e.g., "Friedhofsgeschenke, deck — Standard mit Rangliste")
- Event titles read from rendered UI text (localized) instead of raw localization keys
- Enter on a deck auto-presses the tile's play/continue button (starts match directly)
- Standalone play buttons hidden from navigation (redundant with auto-press on Enter)
- PlayBlade HandleEnter bypass for Recent tab decks (no folders to enter)
- New `RecentPlayAccessor.cs` — reflection wrapper for `LastPlayedBladeContentView` tile data

### Color Challenge (CampaignGraph) Fix
- CampaignGraph no longer misidentified as a PlayBlade overlay — treated as regular content page
- Blade state buttons (Btn_BladeIsClosed, Btn_BladeHoverClosed, Btn_BladeIsOpen) filtered from navigation
- PlayBladeHelper no longer intercepts Enter/Backspace on CampaignGraph
- Backspace exits CampaignGraph via NavigateToHome (game has no native back-to-PlayBlade path)
- Files: `PanelStateManager.cs`, `ElementGroupAssigner.cs`, `GeneralMenuNavigator.cs`

### PlayBlade Fixes
- Fixed stale PlayBladeState when blade GameObject is destroyed during page transition (entering events via Events tab showed empty screen)
- Fixed Backspace not working when game gets stuck in "Waiting for server" loading state
- Fixed PlayBlade auto-entry into content group being overridden by group restore during tab switch (debounce timing issue)
- Fixed Backspace from Events play options going to group level instead of back to tabs (HandleBackspace now checks group type directly instead of unreliable IsPlayBladeContext flag)

### Context System Removed
- Removed legacy context system (ContextManager, GameContext, INavigableContext, Contexts/) — fully superseded by the navigator system
- Removed stale "Main Menu menu. 7 options" announcements on scene change
- Removed unused P/D/S shortcut scoping and dead navigation forwarding code
- F2 "Announce current screen" moved to F3, reimplemented using navigator's ScreenName
- GeneralMenuNavigator now announces "Waiting for server" when the game's loading panel overlay is active

### Loading Screen Navigator
- New `LoadingScreenNavigator` for transitional screens (priority 65)
- **Game Loading**: Announces status messages during startup (e.g., "Starting...", "Waiting for server...")
- **Match End**: Announces victory/defeat result, rank info, navigable buttons (Continue, View Battlefield, Settings)
- **PreGame/Matchmaking**: Announces "Searching for match" with live timer, cycling hints, Cancel and Settings buttons
- Scene-scoped element discovery prevents cross-scene contamination from duel leftovers
- Polling-based element discovery handles late-loading UI (animations, network responses)
- Backspace shortcut: Continue (match end) or Cancel (matchmaking)
- Replaced broken PreBattleNavigator and fixed MatchEndScene handling in GeneralMenuNavigator
- CardInfoNavigator now deactivated on scene change (prevents stale card reading after duel)

### Browser Fixes (Scry, Surveil, London Mulligan)
- Fixed card activation in Scry/Surveil/London browsers using correct game APIs
- Browser card movement now uses drag simulation (HandleDrag/OnDragRelease) instead of RemoveCard/AddCard
- Scry uses card reordering around placeholder, matching how the game processes submissions

### Duel Navigation
- Tab/Enter navigation for prompt button choices (sacrifice, pay cost, etc.)
- Fixed first Tab in duel navigating to emote panel instead of game elements
- Fixed damage assignment browser by prioritizing discovered buttons over PromptButton
- Scoped browser button discovery to scaffold to fix villainous choice browser
- Replaced keyword-based WorkflowBrowser detection with structural check (language-independent)

### Deck Builder
- Card info refreshes after adding/removing cards (Owned/InDeck values update immediately)
- Fixed Tab from search field landing on wrong element instead of Collection
- Collection position resets to first card on page change
- Deck Info group with 2D sub-navigation for deck statistics (card counts, mana curve)

### Installer
- Fixed update check never detecting newer versions (assembly version was always 1.0.0.0)
- Fixed version comparison treating "0.4" and "0.4.0.0" as different versions

---

## v0.4.6 - 2026-02-06

### Card Info Improvements in Deck Builder
- Collection cards now show "Collection: Owned X, In Deck Y" info block (via `PagesMetaCardView._lastDisplayInfo` reflection)
- Deck list cards with unowned copies now announce "Quantity: X, missing" (via `MetaCardView.ShowUnCollectedTreatment` field)

## v0.4.5 - 2026-02-06

### CardPoolAccessor - Direct Collection Page API
- New `CardPoolAccessor` class wraps game's `CardPoolHolder` via reflection
- Collection cards now read from `_pages[1].CardViews` (only current visible page)
- Page navigation uses `ScrollNext()` / `ScrollPrevious()` directly instead of searching for UI buttons
- Page announcements: "Page X of Y" on navigation, "First page" / "Last page" at edges
- Eliminated label-based page filtering system (SaveCollectionCardsForPageFilter, ApplyCollectionPageFilter)
- Fallback to hierarchy scan if CardPoolHolder not found

### Performance Improvements
- Reduced search rescan delay from 30 frames to 12 frames (~645ms at ~18fps game rate)
- Reduced page rescan delay from 20 frames to 8 frames with IsScrolling() short-circuit
- Removed `LogAvailableUIElements()` call from PerformRescan (was 500-750ms debug dump on every rescan)
- UI dump now only runs once per screen in DetectScreen, not on every rescan

### Bug Fixes
- Collection search now shows correct cards (only current page, no offscreen contamination)
- Page navigation no longer requires finding page buttons by name/label matching

### Technical

- `GeneralMenuNavigator.cs` - Rewritten `FindPoolHolderCards()`, `ActivateCollectionPageButton()`, page rescan mechanism
- `GroupedNavigator.cs` - Removed label-based filter fields and methods
- `CardDetector.cs` - Added `CardPoolAccessor.ClearCache()` in cache clearing
- `BaseNavigator.cs` - Reduced `_pendingSearchRescanFrames` from 30 to 12

### Deck Builder Search Field Support
- Search input field in deck builder Filters group now triggers collection rescan after exiting
- Type search term, press Tab to navigate to Collection with filtered results
- Announces "Search results: X cards" after filter applies
- Uses delayed rescan (~500ms) to allow game's filter animation to complete

### Technical
- `ExitInputFieldEditMode()` detects search fields by name and schedules delayed rescan
- `_suppressNavigationAnnouncement` flag prevents announcing stale cards before rescan
- `ForceRescanAfterSearch()` override in GeneralMenuNavigator counts only Collection group items
- `onEndEdit` event invoked when deactivating input fields to trigger game callbacks

---

## v0.4.3 - 2026-02-05

### Booster Chamber (Packs Screen) Overhaul
- Pack carousel now treated as single navigable element with Left/Right arrow navigation

- Each pack plays its own ambient music when centered (proper music switching via PointerExit)
- Wildcard vault progress bars now visible as standalone elements
- Disabled grouped navigation for BoosterChamber (flat list is more appropriate)

### Pack Set Names
- Added set code extraction from `SealedBoosterView.SetCode` property

## v0.2.7 - 2026-01-28

### Bug Fixes
- **Dropdown auto-open on navigation**: Fixed dropdowns auto-opening when navigating to them with arrow keys
  - MTGA auto-opens dropdowns when they receive EventSystem selection
  - Now uses actual `IsExpanded` property from dropdown components instead of focus-based assumptions
  - Auto-opened dropdowns are immediately closed, user must press Enter to open
  - Dropdown suppression handled by DropdownStateManager
  - See Technical Debt section in KNOWN_ISSUES.md for details

- **Dropdown closing**: Escape and Backspace now properly close dropdowns on login screens
  - Previously Escape triggered back navigation instead of closing the dropdown
  - Backspace now works as universal dismiss key for dropdowns
  - Announces "Dropdown closed" when dismissed

- **Input field edit mode detection**: Fixed inconsistent edit mode behavior
  - Game auto-focuses input fields on navigation; mod now properly detects this
  - Separated "selected" state (field navigated to) from "focused" state (caret visible)
  - Escape now properly exits edit mode without triggering back navigation
  - Arrow key reading only activates when field is actually focused
  - KeyboardManagerPatch blocks Escape when on any input field (selected or focused)

- **Input field content reading**: Fixed input fields not announcing their content when navigating
  - Added fallback to `textComponent.text` when `.text` property is empty
  - Added support for legacy Unity `InputField` (not just TMP_InputField)
  - Content now reads correctly when Tab/Escape exits input field

- **Tab navigation on Login screens**: Tab and arrow keys now navigate the same list consistently
  - Tab key is now consumed to prevent game's Tab handling from interfering
  - Disabled grouped navigation on Login scene (not needed for simple forms)
  - Fixed double-navigation issue where game and mod both moved on Tab press

### Technical
- `UIFocusTracker.IsAnyDropdownExpanded()` queries actual `IsExpanded` property via reflection
- `UIFocusTracker.GetExpandedDropdown()` returns currently expanded dropdown for closing
- `BaseNavigator.CloseDropdownOnElement()` closes auto-opened dropdowns and sets suppression flags
- `UIFocusTracker.NavigatorHandlesAnnouncements` prevents duplicate announcements (set from NavigatorManager.HasActiveNavigator)
- `DropdownStateManager.SuppressReentry()` prevents dropdown mode re-entry after auto-close
- `BaseNavigator.HandleDropdownNavigation()` intercepts Enter (silent select) and Escape/Backspace (close)
- `BaseNavigator.SelectDropdownItem()` sets value via reflection without triggering `onValueChanged`
- `CloseActiveDropdown()` finds parent TMP_Dropdown/Dropdown/cTMP_Dropdown and calls `Hide()`
- Enter/Submit blocked from game in dropdown mode via `EventSystemPatch` and `KeyboardManagerPatch`
- `GetElementAnnouncement()` now handles legacy InputField and tries textComponent fallback
- Tab handling uses `InputManager.GetKeyDownAndConsume(KeyCode.Tab)` to block game processing
- `GeneralMenuNavigator.DiscoverElements()` disables grouped navigation when `_currentScene == "Login"`

**Files:** `BaseNavigator.cs`, `UIFocusTracker.cs`, `DropdownStateManager.cs`, `EventSystemPatch.cs`, `KeyboardManagerPatch.cs`, `GeneralMenuNavigator.cs`, `UITextExtractor.cs`, `SCREENS.md`

## v0.2.6 - 2026-01-27

**Files:** `SettingsMenuNavigator.cs`

## v0.2.5 - 2026-01-27

### Bug Fixes (Popup Button - Still Not Working)

Three fixes attempted for popup button activation issue. Popup buttons (e.g., "Continue editing" / "Discard deck") still require two Enter presses despite these changes:

1. **Popup destruction detection during scene change**
   - `AlphaPanelDetector.CleanupDestroyedPanels()` now reports popups as closed when their GameObject is destroyed
   - Previously, destroyed popups were silently removed from tracking without notifying PanelStateManager
   - Uses `ReportPanelClosedByName()` since GameObject reference is null

2. **Enter key consumption in menu navigation**
   - `GeneralMenuNavigator` now uses `InputManager.GetEnterAndConsume()` instead of `Input.GetKeyDown()`
   - Prevents game from processing Enter on EventSystem's selected object (e.g., Nav_Decks) simultaneously
   - Enter key is marked as consumed so Harmony patch blocks it from game's KeyboardManager

3. **SystemMessageButtonView method name fix**
   - Changed from `OnClick()` to `Click()` - the actual method name on SystemMessageButtonView
   - Debug logging revealed available methods: `Init(SystemMessageButtonData, Action)` and `Click()`
   - `TryInvokeMethod` now tries `Click()` first, then `OnClick()`, then `OnButtonClicked()`

**Files:** `AlphaPanelDetector.cs`, `GeneralMenuNavigator.cs`, `UIActivator.cs`

  - Now announces each attacker with name and P/T
  - Example: "2 attackers. Sheoldred 4/5. Graveyard Trespasser 3/4. Declare blockers"

## v0.2.1 - 2026-01-25

### Bug Fixes
- Fix combat state display during Declare Attackers/Blockers phases
  - Creatures no longer incorrectly show as "attacking" or "blocking" before being assigned
  - Game pre-creates IsBlocking on all potential blockers (inactive) - now correctly checks active state
  - Display checks active state while internal counting checks existence (for token compatibility)

### Improvements
