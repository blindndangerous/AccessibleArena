- [x] Phase debounce (100ms) - Prevents announcement spam during auto-skip, only final phase is spoken
- [x] Combat announcements - "Combat begins", "Attacker declared", "Attacker removed"
- [x] Opponent plays - "Opponent played a card" (hand count decrease detection)
- [x] Full localization - All ~80 announcement strings use `Strings.*` properties, translated to 12 languages
- [x] Code cleanup - Debug logging removed, dead code removed, file optimized

### Unified HotHighlight Navigator System (Working)

**Replaced separate TargetNavigator + HighlightNavigator with unified HotHighlightNavigator.**

Key insight: The game's HotHighlight system correctly manages what's highlighted based on game state.
When in targeting mode, only valid targets have HotHighlight. When not targeting, only playable cards
have HotHighlight. We trust the game and scan ALL zones, letting the zone determine behavior.

- [x] HotHighlightNavigator service - Unified Tab navigation for playable cards AND targets
- [x] **Trusts game's highlight system** - No separate mode tracking needed
- [x] Scans ALL zones - Hand, Battlefield, Stack, Player portraits
- [x] Syncs with zone/battlefield navigators so Left/Right works after Tab
- [x] Zone change announcements on Tab: "Hand, Shock, 1 of 2" (same format as zone shortcuts)
  - Player: "Opponent, player, 3 of 3"
- [x] Zone-based activation:
  - Hand cards: Two-click to play
  - All other targets: Single-click to select
- [x] Player target detection - Uses `DuelScene_AvatarView.HighlightSystem._currentHighlightType` via reflection
- [x] Primary button text - When no highlights, announces game state ("Pass", "Resolve", "Next")
- [x] Backspace to cancel - Available when targets are highlighted

**Old navigators moved to `src/Core/Services/old/` for reference/revert:**
- `TargetNavigator.cs` - Had separate _isTargeting mode, auto-enter/exit logic, zone scanning
- `HighlightNavigator.cs` - Had separate playable card cycling, rescan delay logic

**To revert to old navigators:**
1. Move files back from `old/` folder
2. Restore connections in DuelNavigator constructor
3. Replace HotHighlightNavigator.HandleInput() with old TargetNavigator + HighlightNavigator calls
4. Restore auto-detect/auto-exit logic in DuelNavigator.HandleCustomInput()

### Selection Mode (Discard, etc.) - Consolidated into HotHighlightNavigator
**January 2026:** DiscardNavigator was consolidated into HotHighlightNavigator for simpler architecture.

HotHighlightNavigator now detects "selection mode" (discard, choose cards to exile, etc.) by checking for a Submit button with a count AND no valid targets on battlefield. In selection mode, hand cards use single-click to toggle selection instead of two-click to play.

- [x] Selection mode detection - `IsSelectionModeActive()` checks for Submit button + no battlefield targets
- [x] Language-agnostic button detection - Matches any number in button text (works with "Submit 2", "2 abwerfen", "0 bestätigen")
- [x] Enter to toggle - Single-click on hand cards in selection mode
- [x] Selection count announcement - Announces "X cards selected" after toggle

**Old DiscardNavigator moved to:** `src/Core/Services/old/DiscardNavigator.cs`

### Combat Navigator System (Complete)
- [x] CombatNavigator service - Handles declare attackers/blockers phases
- [x] Phase tracking in DuelAnnouncer - `IsInDeclareAttackersPhase`, `IsInDeclareBlockersPhase` properties
- [x] Integration with DuelNavigator - Priority: BrowserNavigator > CombatNavigator > HotHighlightNavigator
- [x] Integration with ZoneNavigator - `GetCombatStateText()` adds combat state to card announcements
- [x] **Language-agnostic button detection** - Uses button GameObject names, not localized text

**Language-Agnostic Button Pattern:**
The mod detects buttons by their **GameObject names** which never change regardless of game language:
- `PromptButton_Primary` - Always the proceed/confirm action
- `PromptButton_Secondary` - Always the cancel/skip action

Button **text** is only used for announcements, not for routing decisions. This works with German, English, or any other language.

**Combat State Detection:**
Cards announce their current state using **model data first** (via `CardModelProvider`), with UI child scan as fallback:
- "attacking" - `Model.Instance.IsAttacking` property (model-based), UI fallback: `IsAttacking` child active
- "attacking, blocked by Cat" - When attacker has `Instance.BlockedByIds` populated, resolves blocker names
- "blocking Angel" - `Model.Instance.IsBlocking` property + `Instance.BlockingIds` resolved to attacker names
- "blocking" - Fallback when `BlockingIds` not yet populated
- "selected to block" - Has `CombatIcon_BlockerFrame` + `SelectedHighlightBattlefield` (UI-only, no model equivalent)
- "can block" - Has `CombatIcon_BlockerFrame` only (during declare blockers phase, UI-only)
- "can attack" - Has `CombatIcon_AttackerFrame` (during declare attackers phase, UI-only)
- "tapped" - Has `TappedIcon` (shown for non-attackers only, since attackers are always tapped)

*Model fields on `MtgCardInstance`:*
- `IsAttacking` (property, bool) - true when declared as attacker
- `IsBlocking` (property, bool) - true when assigned as blocker
- `BlockingIds` (field, `List<uint>`) - InstanceIds of attackers this blocker is blocking
- `BlockedByIds` (field, `List<uint>`) - InstanceIds of blockers blocking this attacker
- Access chain: `GetDuelSceneCDC(card)` → `GetCardModel(cdc)` → `GetModelInstance(model)` → read prop/field

**Targeting State Detection:**
Cards announce targeting relationships using model data:
- "targeting Angel" - When card has `Instance.TargetIds` populated, resolves target names
- "targeting Angel and Dragon" - Multiple targets joined with "and" (2) or ", " (3+)
- "targeted by Lightning Bolt" - When card has `Instance.TargetedByIds` populated, resolves source names
- Shown on both battlefield and stack cards

*Model fields on `MtgCardInstance` / `MtgEntity`:*
- `TargetIds` (field, `List<uint>`) - InstanceIds of what this card targets
- `TargetedByIds` (field, `List<uint>`) - InstanceIds of what is targeting this card
- `ResolveInstanceIdToNameExtended()` scans both battlefield and stack for name resolution

**Planeswalker Loyalty & Counter Reading:**
- Power/Toughness info block expanded to include planeswalker loyalty and counters
- Creatures: "2/3" (unchanged), with counters: "2/3, 3 +1/+1"
- Planeswalkers: "Loyalty 4" (from `Loyalty` property on model, or `Counters[Loyalty]` on battlefield)
- Other permanents with counters: "3 Shield, 2 Lore" etc.
- Counters read from `Instance.Counters` (IReadOnlyDictionary<CounterType, int>) via reflection
- Counter type formatting: P1P1→"+1/+1", M1M1→"-1/-1", others use enum name as-is
- Planeswalker abilities prefixed with loyalty cost: "+2: ability text" (from `LoyaltyCost` StringBackedInt property on ability)
- K key announces all counters on focused card (checks CardNavigator, BattlefieldNavigator, ZoneNavigator, BrowserNavigator)
- `GetCountersFromCard(GameObject)` chains: GetDuelSceneCDC → GetCardModel → GetModelInstance → Counters
- `FormatCounterTypeName(string)` maps enum names to readable strings
- Loyalty counter in `Instance.Counters` is skipped (already covered by explicit `Loyalty` property above)

**Ability CDC Lookup (Planeswalker Activation Browser):**
When a planeswalker is activated, the game opens a SelectCards browser with one CDC per ability. These "ability CDCs" have unusual models:
- `GrpId` = the ability's ID (e.g., 165883), NOT the parent card's GrpId (e.g., 83838)
- `AbilityIds` = empty array
- `Abilities` = empty `AbilityPrintingData[]`
- `Name` resolves to the parent card's name (the title provider handles ability GrpIds)

To get the correct ability text, the mod uses a two-step approach:
1. **Parent cache**: When processing any card with abilities, `_abilityParentCache` maps each `abilityId → (parentCardGrpId, allAbilityIds, cardTitleId)`. This is populated during the normal `Abilities` loop in `ExtractCardInfoFromObject`.
2. **Fallback lookup**: When a model has empty AbilityIds and its GrpId is found in the cache, the ability text provider is called with the parent card's context: `GetAbilityTextByCardAbilityGrpId(parentGrpId, abilityGrpId, allAbilityIds, titleId)`. Some abilities resolve without parent context (self-lookup), others require it (e.g., abilities that reference the card name).

The provider's response is filtered to reject garbage strings: `$`-prefixed, `#`-prefixed (e.g., `#NoTranslationNeeded`), `Ability #NNNNN` patterns, and `Unknown` strings.

This also fixes the known issue "Card Abilities With High IDs Not Resolving" — the high IDs were ability GrpIds being treated as card GrpIds.

**Declare Attackers Phase:**
- [x] Space key handling - Clicks `PromptButton_Primary` (whatever text: "All Attack", "X Attackers", etc.)
- [x] Backspace key handling - Clicks `PromptButton_Secondary` (whatever text: "No Attacks", etc.)
- [x] Attacker state detection - `IsAttacking` child indicates declared attacker state

**Note:** Game requires two presses to complete attack declaration:
1. First Space: Selects attackers (button shows "All Attack")
2. Second Space: Confirms attackers (button shows "X Attackers")

**Declare Blockers Phase:**
- [x] Space key handling - Clicks `PromptButton_Primary` (whatever text: "X Blocker", "Next", "Confirm", etc.)
- [x] Backspace key handling - Clicks `PromptButton_Secondary` (whatever text: "No Blocks", "Cancel Blocks", etc.)
- [x] **Full blocker state announcements** - "can block", "selected to block", "blocking" (see Combat State Detection above)
- [x] **Attacker announcements during blockers** - Enemy attackers announce ", attacking" (or ", attacking, blocked by Cat")
- [x] **Blocker state detection** - Model-based via `CardModelProvider.GetIsBlockingFromCard()`, UI fallback for active `IsBlocking` child
- [x] **Blocker-attacker relationships** - Resolves `BlockingIds`/`BlockedByIds` to card names for rich announcements
- [x] **Blocker selection tracking** - Tracks selected blockers via `SelectedHighlightBattlefield` + `CombatIcon_BlockerFrame`
- [x] **Combined P/T announcements** - Announces "X/Y blocking" when selection changes
- [x] **Blocker assignment announcements** - "Cat blocking Angel" (or "Cat assigned" if BlockingIds not yet populated)

**Blocker Selection System:**
- `IsCreatureSelectedAsBlocker(card)` - Checks for both `CombatIcon_BlockerFrame` AND `SelectedHighlightBattlefield` active (UI-only, no model equivalent)
- `FindSelectedBlockers()` - Returns all CDC cards currently selected as blockers
- `GetPowerToughness(card)` - Extracts P/T from card using `CardDetector.ExtractCardInfo()`
- `CalculateCombinedStats(blockers)` - Sums power and toughness across all selected blockers
- `UpdateBlockerSelection()` - Called each frame, detects selection changes, announces combined stats and blocker-attacker pairings
- `GetBlockingText(card)` / `GetBlockedByText(card)` - Resolve combat relationships to card names via `CardModelProvider`
- `FindPromptButton(isPrimary)` - Language-agnostic button finder by GameObject name
- Tracking uses `HashSet<int>` of instance IDs to detect changes efficiently
- Resets tracking when entering/exiting blockers phase

  - Auto-exits when focus moves to non-player-zone element

**Player Info Zone Shortcuts:**
- V: Enter player info zone (starts on your info)
- Left/Right: Switch between you and opponent (preserves property index)
- Up/Down: Cycle properties (Life, Timer, Timeouts, Games Won, Rank)
- Enter: Open emote wheel (your portrait only)
- Backspace: Exit zone (restores previous focus)

**Files:**
- `src/Core/Services/PlayerPortraitNavigator.cs` - Main navigator with focus management
- `src/Core/Services/InputManager.cs` - Key consumption infrastructure
- `src/Patches/KeyboardManagerPatch.cs` - Harmony patch for game's KeyboardManager

### Mana Color Picker Navigator (Complete)
- [x] ManaColorPickerNavigator service - Detects ManaColorSelector popup via reflection
- [x] Integration with DuelNavigator - Highest priority (before BrowserNavigator)
- [x] Tab/Shift+Tab and Left/Right navigation through available colors
- [x] Enter selects focused color, number keys 1-6 for direct selection
- [x] Multi-pick support - Sequential picks with re-announcement after each
- [x] Backspace cancels via TryCloseSelector
- [x] Localized in all 12 languages

**Detection:**
- Polls for `ManaColorSelector` instances via `FindObjectsOfType` (100ms interval)
- Checks `IsOpen` property on found instances
- Reads `_selectionProvider` (protected field) for available colors and selection state

**Reflection Access:**
- `ManaColorSelector.IsOpen` (public property) - detection
- `ManaColorSelector._selectionProvider` (protected field) - color data
- `ManaColorSelector.SelectColor(ManaColor)` (protected method) - selection
- `ManaColorSelector.TryCloseSelector()` (public method) - cancel
- `IManaSelectorProvider.ValidSelectionCount`, `GetElementAt`, `MaxSelections`, `AllSelectionsComplete`, `CurrentSelection`
- `ManaProducedData.PrimaryColor` (field or property) - color enum value

### Priority Controller (Full Control & Phase Stops)

Reflection wrapper for GameManager.AutoRespManager and ButtonPhaseLadder. Provides keyboard access to full control and phase stop toggles that are otherwise only accessible via mouse clicks on the phase ladder UI.

**Why reflection instead of simulating clicks:**
The phase ladder UI requires the ladder to be visible and expanded. The EventTrigger `AllowStop` guard on `PhaseLadderButton.ToggleStop()` blocks toggling when the ladder isn't visible. PriorityController bypasses this by calling `ButtonPhaseLadder.ToggleTransientStop(button)` directly, which sends the stop change to the GRE (game rules engine) regardless of UI state.

**Full Control (P / Shift+P):**
- `GameManager.AutoRespManager.ToggleFullControl()` - temporary, resets on phase change
- `GameManager.AutoRespManager.ToggleLockedFullControl()` - permanent until toggled off
- State read via `FullControlEnabled` / `FullControlLocked` properties

**Phase Stops (1-0 keys):**
- Reads `PhaseIcons` field on `ButtonPhaseLadder` (List of 22 PhaseLadderButton items)
- Filters out `AvatarPhaseIcon` buttons (player-specific stops), keeps only `ButtonPhaseIcon`
- Reads `_playerStopTypes` (private field on base class `PhaseLadderButton`) to map StopType enum values to buttons
- Key 7 maps to both `FirstStrikeDamageStep` and `CombatDamageStep` buttons
- After toggle, reads `StopState` property (SettingStatus enum) to announce set/cleared

**Reflection note:** `_playerStopTypes` is private on the base class `PhaseLadderButton`, not on `ButtonPhaseIcon`. Standard `GetField()` with `NonPublic | Instance` does not search base classes for private fields. `GetFieldInHierarchy()` walks up the type hierarchy to find it.

**Phase stop behavior (game mechanic, not mod limitation):**
Phase stops are "also stop here" markers. They do NOT skip ahead to the marked phase. The game always stops when you have playable actions, regardless of phase stops. Setting a stop at "Declare Attackers" means "also stop at declare attackers even if I have nothing to do there" - it does not skip Main 1.

**Files:**
- `src/Core/Services/PriorityController.cs` - Reflection wrapper
- `src/Core/Services/DuelNavigator.cs` - Key handling (P, Shift+P, 1-0)
- `src/Patches/KeyboardManagerPatch.cs` - Ctrl key blocking in duels

### Element Grouping System (Menu Navigation)

Hierarchical navigation for menu screens. Elements are organized into groups for two-level navigation: first navigate between groups, then enter a group to navigate its elements.

**Architecture:**
- `ElementGroup.cs` - Enum defining group types (Primary, Play, Content, PlayBladeTabs, PlayBladeContent, etc.)
- `ElementGroupAssigner.cs` - Assigns elements to groups based on parent hierarchy and naming patterns
- `GroupedNavigator.cs` - Two-level navigation state machine (GroupList ↔ InsideGroup)
- `OverlayDetector.cs` - Detects which overlay is active (popup, social, PlayBlade, settings)
- `PlayBladeNavigationHelper.cs` - State machine for PlayBlade-specific navigation flow

**Navigation Flow:**
- Arrow keys navigate at current level (groups or elements)
- Enter enters a group or activates an element
- Backspace exits a group or closes an overlay

**Group Types:**
- Standard groups: Primary, Play, Progress, Navigation, Filters, Content, Settings, Secondary
- Overlay groups (suppress others): Popup, Social, PlayBladeTabs, PlayBladeContent, PlayBladeFolders, SettingsMenu, NPE, DeckBuilderCollection, Mailbox
- Single-element groups become "standalone" (directly activatable at group level)
- Folder groups for deck folders (auto-expand toggle on Enter)
- DeckBuilderCollection group for cards in deck builder's PoolHolder (card collection grid)

**PlayBlade Navigation:**
PlayBladeNavigationHelper handles all PlayBlade-specific Enter/Backspace logic:
- Derives state from `GroupedNavigator.CurrentGroup` (no separate state machine)
- `HandleEnter(element, group)` → returns `PlayBladeResult` (NotHandled/Handled/RescanNeeded/CloseBlade)
- `HandleQueueTypeEntry(element)` → handles queue type subgroup entry (virtual or real tab activation)
- `HandleBackspace()` → returns `PlayBladeResult`

**Queue Type Tab Structure (February 2026):**
The original "Find Match" tab was replaced by three queue type tabs at the same level as Events and Recent:
- **PlayBladeTabs:** [Events, Ranked, Open Play, Brawl, Recent]
- FindMatch nav tab is excluded from navigation (hidden via `ElementGroupAssigner`)
- Queue type tabs (`Blade_Tab_Ranked`, `Blade_Tab_Deluxe`) are promoted to PlayBladeTabs group

**Why this restructure:**
The original Find Match tab opened a mixed view containing queue type tabs, queue items, and a BO3 toggle. This was confusing for screen reader users who had to navigate through nested tabs. By promoting queue types to the top level, users get a flatter, more predictable navigation: pick a queue type → see its queue items → select and play.

**Virtual vs Real Entries:**
Queue type tabs only exist as GameObjects when the FindMatch blade view is active. When Events/Recent is showing, virtual subgroup entries (`GameObject = null`) are injected into PlayBladeTabs by `GroupedNavigator.PostProcessPlayBladeTabs()`. This uses the same subgroup pattern as Objectives within Progress.

**Two-Step Activation:**
When entering a virtual queue type entry (FindMatch not active):
1. Helper stores pending queue type, clicks FindMatch game tab → blade switch → rescan
2. Post-organize finds real queue type tab, clicks it → `NeedsFollowUpRescan` → rescan
3. Auto-enters PlayBladeContent with queue items

When entering a real queue type entry (FindMatch already active):
1. Helper clicks tab directly → rescan → auto-enters PlayBladeContent

**Position Restore:**
`_lastQueueTypeTabIndex` preserves cursor position when navigating back from content to tabs via Backspace. User returns to the queue type entry they came from.

**BO3 Toggle Fix:**
Game uses placeholder text "POSITION" for the Best of 3 toggle label. Fixed at two levels: `UITextExtractor.GetToggleText()` replaces "POSITION" with localized "Best of 3", and `UIElementClassifier.TryClassifyAsToggle()` provides a safety net.

**Element Exclusions:**
- FindMatch nav tab → `ElementGroup.Unknown` (replaced by queue type entries)
- MainButton (Play/Spielen) inside blade → `ElementGroup.Unknown` (global button, not blade content)
- NewDeck/CreateDeck inside blade → `ElementGroup.Unknown` (not relevant in FindMatch context)
- Elements with `ElementGroup.Unknown` are skipped entirely in `OrganizeIntoGroups()`

Navigation flow:
- Tabs → Queue Type Entry → Content (queue items) → Deck Folders → Folder (decks)
- Backspace: Folders/Content → Tabs (landing on last queue type) → Close blade

**Integration:**
- GeneralMenuNavigator creates GroupedNavigator and PlayBladeNavigationHelper
- DiscoverElements calls `_groupedNavigator.OrganizeIntoGroups()`
- Navigation methods (MoveNext, MovePrevious, etc.) delegate to GroupedNavigator when active
- Backspace handling: calls `_playBladeHelper.HandleBackspace()` first, acts on result
- Enter handling: calls `_playBladeHelper.HandleEnter()` before activation, triggers rescan if needed

### Browser Navigator System (Complete)

Refactored into 3 files following the CardDetector/DuelNavigator/ZoneNavigator pattern.

**Architecture:**
- `BrowserDetector.cs` - Static browser detection and caching (like CardDetector)
- `BrowserNavigator.cs` - Orchestrator for browser lifecycle and generic navigation (like DuelNavigator)
- `BrowserZoneNavigator.cs` - Two-zone navigation for Scry/Surveil and London mulligan (like ZoneNavigator)

**Features:**
- [x] Browser scaffold detection - Finds `BrowserScaffold_*` GameObjects (Scry, Surveil, London, etc.)
- [x] Card holder detection - `BrowserCardHolder_Default` (keep) and `BrowserCardHolder_ViewDismiss` (dismiss)
- [x] Tab navigation - Cycles through all cards in browser
- [x] Zone navigation (C/D keys) - C for top/keep zone, D for bottom zone
- [x] Card movement - Enter toggles card between zones
- [x] Card state announcements - Zone-based ("Keep on top", "Put on bottom")
- [x] Space to confirm - Clicks `PromptButton_Primary`
- [x] Backspace to cancel - Clicks `PromptButton_Secondary`
- [x] Scry/Surveil - Full keyboard support with two-zone navigation
- [x] London Mulligan - Full keyboard support for putting cards on bottom

**Browser Types Supported:**
- Scry - View top card(s), choose keep on top or put on bottom
- Surveil - Similar to scry, dismissed cards go to graveyard
- Read Ahead - Saga chapter selection
- London Mulligan - Select cards to put on bottom after mulliganing
- Opening Hand/Mulligan - View starting hand, keep or mulligan
- AssignDamage - Distribute attacker's combat damage among blockers (see below)
- ViewDismiss - Card preview popup (auto-dismissed, see below)
- SelectCardsMultiZone - Cards from multiple zones with zone selector (Up/Down cycles zones, Tab moves to cards)
- Generic browsers - YesNo, Dungeon, SelectCards, OptionalAction, etc. (Tab + Enter)

**ViewDismiss Auto-Dismiss:**
- The game opens a `BrowserScaffold_ViewDismiss` popup when clicking on graveyard/exile cards
- This popup traps Unity focus on `BrowserCardHolder_ViewDismiss`, blocking keyboard navigation
- BrowserNavigator detects the ViewDismiss scaffold but does NOT enter browser mode
- Instead, it immediately clicks the `DismissButton` via `UIActivator.Activate()` to close the popup
- A `_viewDismissDismissed` flag prevents repeated clicks while the scaffold is still closing
- The flag resets when no browser is detected (scaffold gone)

**Zone Navigation:**
- **C** - Enter top/keep zone (Scry: "Keep on top", London: "Keep pile")
- **D** - Enter bottom zone (Scry: "Put on bottom", London: "Bottom of library")
- **Left/Right** - Navigate within current zone
- **Enter** - Toggle card between zones
- **Tab** - Navigate all cards (detects zone automatically for activation)

**Damage Assignment Browser:**
When an attacker is blocked by multiple creatures, the game opens an AssignDamage browser to distribute combat damage.
- **Detection**: `BrowserDetector` identifies `BrowserType == "AssignDamage"`; browser ref cached from `GameManager.BrowserManager.CurrentBrowser`
- **Navigation**: Left/Right cycles between blocker cards; Up/Down adjusts the damage spinner on the focused blocker
- **Spinner access**: `_idToSpinnerMap` (Dictionary: InstanceId → SpinnerAnimated) cached from the AssignDamageBrowser via reflection
- **Spinner control**: Clicks `_buttonIncrease` / `_buttonDecrease` on SpinnerAnimated, reads `Value` property after click
- **Lethal detection**: Reads `_valueText` TMP color - gold color means lethal damage reached
- **Total damage**: Lazily cached from `MtgDamageAssigner.TotalDamage` field (accessed via `WorkflowController.CurrentWorkflow._damageAssigner`)
- **Assigner count**: Reads `_handledAssigners` (List) and `_unhandledAssigners` (Queue) to show "X of Y" when multiple attackers need damage assigned
- **Submit**: Invokes `DoneAction` event field on the browser (falls back to `OnButtonCallback("DoneButton")`)
- **Undo**: Invokes `UndoAction` event field on the browser
- **Announcements**: Entry shows attacker name + power + blocker count; per-card shows name + P/T + assigned damage + lethal status

**Technical Implementation:**
- BrowserDetector caches scan results for performance (100ms interval)
- Only detects CardBrowserCardHolder from DEFAULT holder (ViewDismiss without scaffold is animation remnant)
- Zone detection from parent hierarchy (Scry) or API methods (London: `IsInHand`/`IsInLibrary`)
- Card movement via reflection: Scry uses `RemoveCard`/`AddCard`, London uses `HandleDrag`/`OnDragRelease`

### Store Navigator (February 2026)

Dedicated navigator for the Store screen. Uses a three-level navigation model (Tabs, Items, Purchase Options) with popup handling and a card details view.

**Architecture:**
- `StoreNavigator.cs` - Standalone navigator with custom store-specific navigation
- Priority 85 (above GeneralMenuNavigator at 15)
- Uses BaseNavigator's built-in popup detection via `EnablePopupDetection()`

**Navigation Model:**
- **Tab level (Up/Down)**: Navigate store tabs (Featured, Packs, Decks, etc.)
- **Item level (Up/Down)**: Navigate items within current tab
- **Purchase options (Left/Right)**: Cycle between Details, Gems, Gold purchase options
- **Enter/Space**: Activate current purchase option or open details view
- **Backspace**: Go back one level (Items → Tabs → Exit store)

**Details View (Card List):**
Store items that contain decks or bundles offer a "Details" option as the first purchase option. When activated:
- Extracts card list from `StoreDisplayPreconDeck.CardData` or `StoreDisplayCardViewBundle.BundleCardViews`
- Left/Right navigates between cards (announced as "CardName, times Qty, ManaCost, X of N")
- Up/Down navigates card info blocks (same as all other card contexts via `CardDetector.BuildInfoBlocks`)
- Card info extracted via `CardModelProvider.ExtractCardInfoFromObject(cardDataObj)` using the stored CardData object
- Backspace closes details view, returns to item navigation

**Popup Handling:**
StoreNavigator uses BaseNavigator's built-in popup mode with dual detection:
- **PanelStateManager events**: BaseNavigator's `EnablePopupDetection()` auto-detects system popups (SystemMessageView, Dialog, etc.)
- **Confirmation modal polling**: Polls `_confirmationModalField` on the store controller to detect the store's own confirmation modal (uses `EnterPopupMode()` manually)
- When popup is active, navigation switches to popup elements (Up/Down navigate, Enter activates, Backspace dismisses)
- Dismissal tries: modal `Close()` method, cancel button pattern matching, `SystemMessageView.OnBack()`

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Uses reflection to access `ContentController_StoreCarousel` internals (tabs, items, confirmation modal)
- Item descriptions extracted from active tag text and tooltip LocString
- Purchase options extracted from `PurchaseButton` structs on `StoreItemBase` components
- Details view stores raw `CardData` objects in `DetailCardEntry.CardDataObj` for direct extraction (avoids dependency on `_cachedDeckHolder` which doesn't exist in Store scene)

**Files:**
- `src/Core/Services/StoreNavigator.cs` - Main navigator implementation

### Mastery Navigator (February 2026)

Dedicated navigator for the Mastery/Rewards screen. Replaces GeneralMenuNavigator's flat element list with structured level-based navigation.

**Architecture:**
- `MasteryNavigator.cs` - Standalone navigator with custom level/tier navigation
- Priority 60 (above StoreNavigator at 55, below LoadingScreenNavigator at 65)
- Uses BaseNavigator's built-in popup detection via `EnablePopupDetection()`

**Navigation Model:**
- **Virtual status item (index 0)**: XP progress info + action buttons as tiers
  - Left/Right cycles: Status info, Mastery Tree, Previous Season, Purchase, Back
  - Enter activates the selected button tier
- **Levels (Up/Down)**: Navigate mastery levels with reward announcements
- **Tiers (Left/Right)**: Cycle between Free, Premium, Renewal reward tiers within a level
- **Enter**: Announce detailed level info (all tiers, quantities, completion status)
- **PageUp/PageDown**: Jump ~10 levels with page sync
- **Home/End**: Jump to status item / last level
- **Backspace**: Return to Home screen

**Data Access:**
- `ProgressionTracksContentController` detection via MonoBehaviour scan + `IsOpen` check
- `RewardTrackView._levels` and `_levelRewardData` for level/reward data
- `SetMasteryDataProvider.GetCurrentLevelIndex()` for completion status
- `MTGALocalizedString` key resolution via `Languages.ActiveLocProvider`

**Files:**
- `src/Core/Services/MasteryNavigator.cs` - Main navigator implementation

---

### Advanced Filters Navigator (February 2026)

Dedicated navigator for the Advanced Filters popup in Collection/Deck Builder screens. Uses grid-based navigation instead of flat list navigation for better accessibility.

**Architecture:**
- `AdvancedFiltersNavigator.cs` - Standalone navigator with grid-based row/column navigation
- Priority 87 (above RewardPopupNavigator at 86, below SettingsMenuNavigator at 90)

**Navigation Model:**
- **Up/Down (W/S)**: Switch between rows (Types, Rarity, Actions)
- **Left/Right (A/D)**: Navigate within current row
- **Home/End**: Jump to first/last item in row
- **Enter/Space**: Toggle checkbox or activate button/dropdown
- **Backspace**: Dismiss popup without applying filters

**Discovered Rows:**
1. **Types row** - Card type filters (Creature, Planeswalker, Instant, etc.)
2. **Rarity row** - Rarity filters (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Mythic Rare, Basic Lands)
3. **Actions row** - Collection filters, Format dropdown, OK button

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Stores Toggle component references during discovery for consistent state reading
- Uses `DropdownStateManager` for dropdown mode detection and blocking navigation while dropdown is open
- Enter blocked from game in dropdown mode; items selected silently via reflection (dropdown stays open)
- Calls `DropdownStateManager.UpdateAndCheckExitTransition()` each frame to track dropdown state
- Uses `UIActivator.Activate()` for proper game event triggering (not direct toggle.isOn manipulation)
- Consumes Enter/Space/Backspace keys to prevent GeneralMenuNavigator from processing them after popup closes
- Tries to click background blocker on Backspace to dismiss without applying filters

**Game Behavior Notes:**
- Game enforces "at least one type must be selected" - toggling the last selected type will be reset by game
- Creature and Planeswalker toggles may appear linked due to game's filter logic
- Closing with OK button applies filters and may trigger game's deck validation dialog

**Files:**
- `src/Core/Services/AdvancedFiltersNavigator.cs` - Main navigator implementation

## Known Issues

See [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for active bugs, limitations, and planned features.

## Deployment

### File Locations
- Mod: `C:\Program Files\Wizards of the Coast\MTGA\Mods\AccessibleArena.dll`
- Tolk: `C:\Program Files\Wizards of the Coast\MTGA\Tolk.dll`
- NVDA client: `C:\Program Files\Wizards of the Coast\MTGA\nvdaControllerClient64.dll`
- Log: `C:\Program Files\Wizards of the Coast\MTGA\MelonLoader\Latest.log`

### Build & Deploy
Build outputs to game's Mods folder. Tolk DLLs must be in game root.

## Modding Stack

- MelonLoader - Mod loader
- HarmonyX (0Harmony.dll) - Method patching for game event interception
- Tolk - Screen reader communication
- Target: .NET Framework 4.7.2

## Technical Notes

### Harmony Patching (DuelAnnouncer)
The DuelAnnouncer uses manual Harmony patching (not attribute-based) because:
- MelonLoader's auto-patching runs before game assemblies are loaded
- Manual patching in OnInitializeMelon() ensures types are available

Patched method: `Wotc.Mtga.DuelScene.UXEvents.UXEventQueue.EnqueuePending()`
- Intercepts all UX events as they flow through the game's event system
- Postfix reads event data without modifying game state

Key event types detected:
- `UpdateTurnUXEvent` - Turn changes (fields: `_turnNumber`, `_activePlayer`)
- `UpdateZoneUXEvent` - Zone state changes (field: `_zone` with zone info string)
- `UXEventUpdatePhase` - Phase changes (fields: `<Phase>k__BackingField`, `<Step>k__BackingField`)
- `ToggleCombatUXEvent` - Combat state (field: `_CombatMode`)

Stack card detection: Uses delayed coroutine (3 frames + 0.2s retry) to allow card to appear in scene before reading name via `CardDetector.GetCardName()`.

Privacy protection: Never reveals opponent's hidden information (hand contents, library).

### Harmony Patching (PanelStatePatch - Menu Panels)
Detects menu panel state changes (open/close) via Harmony patches for reliable overlay handling.

Patched controllers: NavContentController, SettingsMenu, DeckSelectBlade

See `docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md` "Panel State Detection (Harmony Patches)" section for full technical details.
