## Game
Magic: The Gathering Arena

## Prompts Completed
- [x] sanity-checks-setup.md
- [x] information-gathering-and-checking.md
- [x] code-directory-construction.md
- [x] large-file-handling.md

## Prompts Remaining
- [ ] input-handling.md
- [ ] string-builder.md
- [x] high-level-cleanup.md
- [ ] low-level-cleanup.md
- [ ] finalization.md

## Scratchpad Files
- `current_status.md` — this file
- `code-index/` — 95 index files covering all 91 source files (declarations + line numbers)

## Large File Handling Summary
- **CardModelProvider.cs** (5,250 → 2,185 lines): Split into 5 files:
  - CardModelProvider.cs — core card access, name lookup, mana parsing, card info extraction
  - CardTextProvider.cs (606 lines) — ability text, flavor text, artist, localized text
  - CardStateProvider.cs (1,170 lines) — attachments, combat, targeting, counters, categorization
  - DeckCardProvider.cs (795 lines) — deck list, sideboard, read-only deck cards
  - ExtendedCardInfoProvider.cs (609 lines) — keyword descriptions, linked faces
- Other large files (GeneralMenuNavigator, BaseNavigator, DuelAnnouncer, UIActivator, BrowserNavigator, StoreNavigator, UITextExtractor) analyzed and determined to be single-concern — no splits needed
- Also fixed: collection card verbose label bug, help/extended info item position format (content before position)
- Commit: c0829ae

## High-Level Cleanup Summary
- **ReflectionUtils** (`src/Core/Utils/ReflectionUtils.cs`): Centralized `PrivateInstance`/`PublicInstance`/`AllInstanceFlags` constants and `FindType()` method. Replaced inline BindingFlags across ~30 files.
- **GameTypeNames** (`src/Core/Constants/GameTypeNames.cs`): Centralized ~50 hardcoded game type name strings. Used via `T = ...GameTypeNames` alias.
- **SceneNames** (`src/Core/Constants/SceneNames.cs`): Centralized scene name constants (DuelScene, Bootstrap, etc.).
- **GetButtonText consolidation**: Removed duplicate in HotHighlightNavigator, now uses UITextExtractor.GetButtonText().
- **Empty catch blocks**: Added comments/logging to ~80 empty catch blocks across 22 files.
- **Scene scan caching**: Cached `IsAnyInputFieldFocused` fallback (0.5s), `IsAnyDropdownExpanded`/`GetExpandedDropdown` (0.25s), `DetectActiveContentController` (0.5s). Validated cached objects, invalidated on events + scene change.
- Also fixed 3 bugs found during testing: reward popup crash, dropdown navigation, collection keyword descriptions.

## Key Findings
- 95 source files (91 original + 4 new), ~55,750 lines of code
- CLAUDE.md was 95%+ accurate; fixed BrowserTypeScry reference, added Game & Framework section
- Created llm-docs/ with architecture overview, source inventory, and framework reference
- Docs updated to reflect the split (BEST_PRACTICES, MOD_STRUCTURE, SCREENS, llm-docs)
